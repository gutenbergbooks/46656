<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c002'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />A PILOT WHO LIKED SPOOKS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >“Scared?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Not a bit!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry Duncan, just behind the pilot who had
asked the question, answered it in his usual,
cool manner.</p>

<p class='c004' >Behind him in the three-place open cockpit
biplane, his thirteen-year-old chum displayed
none of his calm.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’m scared!” Chick cried as the pilot cut
down his throttle. Chick raised his voice to a
tremulous shout, “Scott—turn back.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The man at the controls laughed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don’t be a baby!” he counseled. “Just because
you see a cloud begin to look shimmery—the
first sign of the ghost, according to all the
pilots who have seen it—don’t lose your nerve.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But—this ghost hunt might be dangerous,”
Chick began to plead. “C-can’t you—Scott, can’t
you t-turn and go out on the bay?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No. I cut the gun too much and the engine
died. We have to glide in, dead-stick, to the
best landing we can.” There was no regret in
the pilot’s voice. He proposed to carry through
his purposes.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But—” Chick was hopeful as he offered an
argument, “in the dark here, the swamp is dangerous—you
might miss water and you’d get
the wings torn in the grass.” He added quickly,
“or you may get our pontoons bogged—” As
the airport searchlight made a cloud glow he
cried, “Yes—bogged down in the ooze.” He expected
to see the ship bank, indicating that his
hint was being acted on.</p>

<p class='c004' >Instead the ship’s nose went down. Scott,
with a little laugh of amusement at Chickering
Brown’s fears, found additional terrors for the
youngest of the pair with them.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes,” he agreed, “and then the spectre that
always appears in the clouds might fly down on
us and say ‘boo!’”</p>

<p class='c004' >He turned, as they glided, high above the
swamp.</p>

<p class='c004' >“How about it, Garry? Wouldn’t that be
awful?” Garfield Duncan, fifteen-year-old
student-pilot and assistant to an airport manager’s
nephew, answered seriously.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Terrible!” he agreed, “but it would be
Chick’s own fault. He was so interested in the
mystery that he vowed he wouldn’t be scared.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well!” Chick hoped for one means of allaying
his fears—light. “Why don’t you throw over
a landing flare, Scott! It’s pitchy-black down
in the marsh.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Scott will get us down, even without power.”
Garry voiced his confidence in the test pilot who
knew the channels and open water spaces like
a book. “Great Scott,” as they had nicknamed
him, made many test flights for the American
branch of a foreign seaplane manufacturer; of
late, since an airport had been inaugurated in
connection with the seaplane “base,” Scott had
flown over the marsh at night, conducting tests
of new lighting equipment, spotlight, searchlight
and beacon.</p>

<p class='c004' >“If you’re afraid,” he added, “try whistling,
Chick, my boy! I’ve heard that ghosts won’t
come around if you whistle.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Usually Garry did not tease his younger
chum; but Chick had been so confident of his
own bravery, had so insistently begged to be
one of the “spook trappers,” that Chick’s terror
in the face of darkness—and of nothing worse,
so far—prompted him to be a little sarcastic.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s all very well to sneer,” said Chick. “I
wasn’t scared, back in the design room—but
here—” he stopped. They had been filing blue-prints
in the plant of an Italian aircraft building
company when Scott, its test pilot, had come
quietly into the blue-print room where Garry
made the multitudes of blue-prints from pen
drawings for the many detailed parts of the
company’s product.</p>

<p class='c004' >The secrecy of his entrance had fascinated
Garry’s more youthful companion, who filed the
blue-prints and sketches. Chick had caught a
hint of something secretive about Scott; it had
fired his ready imagination and he had been so
eager to hover close that Scott, after a moment
of hesitation, had included him in the proposal
he had made.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You both realize how serious that Sky Spook
scare has come to be,” he had whispered. “I
wasn’t going to say anything to Chick, because
he’s pretty young—” at once Chick had denied
the insinuation, “—all right, Chick,” Scott had
continued. “Just the same, I wasn’t going to
include you—but it may help, at that—if you
are ‘game’ and not scarey.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Assured of Chick’s absolute bravery and perfect
gameness the test pilot had suggested that
he wanted to “get to the bottom—or top—of
the spook business.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Ever since the first pilot cracked up,” he
had said, “and explained that he thought he
saw a spooky-looking crate flying straight at
him out of a cloud, I’ve thought he was trying
to ‘cover up’ his own carelessness with that
story. The next one to see ‘it’ must have caught
the scare and had an overdose of imaginittis.
But it has gotten into the newspapers and they
call the new airport ‘Mystery Airport.’ It’s
ruining business for Don McLeod’s uncle, and
I’d like to help him out by proving that there
isn’t any ghost ship flying in and out of the
clouds to make a pass at every pilot whose firm
gives the new airport its business.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry had agreed with Scott’s theory that
some hidden enemy was trying to ruin the airport’s
business, and hamper its growth. Readily
he had consented to help Scott with his
simple plan, which required that with Scott the
two youths would fly, that night, inviting the
appearance of the ghostly, or human apparition,
at which time Scott felt confident that he could
run down the culprit and end the scare before it
further harmed the morale of the flying force
or resulted in the loss of contracts for air line
hangar space and landing and take-off fees.</p>

<p class='c004' >The eagerness with which Chick had seconded
the plan, his pleading to be included in the airplane’s
passengers as an observer and signalman,
his stout declarations of his complete fearlessness,
had suddenly become empty boasts
when the three-place ship had reached the
vicinity of the swamps adjacent to the airport
but not yet drained and prepared for filling in.
Eventually the greater part of the swamps
would be changed into good ground. Engineers
were already preparing to drain away the salt
tides flowing in from Long Island Sound and
Little Neck Bay. Unless the unexplained mystery
of the spectral sky denizen could be settled,
it seemed unlikely that the swamp land need
ever be reclaimed for airport expansion.</p>

<p class='c004' >Scott, for years the hangar supervisor and
chief test pilot for the airplane construction
plant and seaplane base which had existed before
the airport project in combination with
them had been started, was very anxious, it
seemed, to end the ghost scare.</p>

<p class='c004' >With his two youthful aides, confident Garry
and shivering Chick, he made a good descent
to the surface of a wide sheet of enclosed, shallow
water, let the amphibian craft, which could
make either earth or water landings, run out
of momentum, and then sat back, loosening his
helmet chin straps.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Here’s the full plan,” he turned around in
the cockpit in the dark, salty-smelling marsh,
silent except for the plash of a leaping fish or
the cry of a gull seeking a belated dinner, “I
didn’t want to be seen talking too long at the
plant. You never know who ‘might be’—you
know!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I understand,” admitted Garry. “Let’s hear
it all.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I went to Don as soon as I left you—and
he’s managed to get Mr. McLeod to let him go
aloft in the Dart.” He referred to a light, fast
two-seater, the personal property of the airport
manager, which his seventeen-year-old
nephew had secured for the evening. “Now, Don
is as good an amateur pilot as you’ll find; but
he lacks stunting experience. He will come here,
set down, and then I’ll take the Dart and keep
it warmed up and ready, while Don, with you
two for observers, will go up and cruise
around—and invite Mr. Ghost to come at you!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick shivered and muttered under his breath.
“If Mr. Spectre shows up, you signal to
me——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I know.” Garry recalled arrangements used
in other night communications, during night
tests. “If the spook appears in the clouds, we
set off a red flare. If ‘it’ takes off from the
ground, we give you a green Verey signal and
you’ll be able to catch anything slower than
greased lightning in that Dart—and drive down
the ghost and prove it’s only some human person,
after all.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well, that’s what I hope to do.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Sup—supposing it isn’t a h-human being?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That would tickle me to pieces, Chick, old
top,” laughed the pilot. “I’d sort of like to have
it turn out that way. Why? Because I never
shook hands with a ghost, and it ought to be a
right nice experience.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“He—it would scare you out of your togs!”
scoffed Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh, no!” Scott assured him. “Spectres, if
they really do exist, can’t hurt you. It’s only
your fear that can do you any harm. Now, I
like spooks!&mdash;-”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes?” Garry pointed up toward the July
night sky. “Well, there’s one! Go up and get
acquainted. We’ll wait here!”</p>

<p class='c004' >He had meant to joke, to terrify Chick; but
he became silent and a trifle awed.</p>

<p class='c004' >There was—something!—black against a luminous
Summer cloud!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c002'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />THE AIRPLANE GUARD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Shuddering, terrified, Chick clung to Garry’s
steady arm as he gazed upward.</p>

<p class='c004' >One of the clustered clouds seemed to be
picked out from the others by a phosphorescent
glow: it was luminous but not fiery; whitish in
tint rather than ruddy.</p>

<p class='c004' >Out of it came a silent, gliding, dark shape—an airplane!</p>

<p class='c004' >For a brief interval Garry felt his own blood
chilling. That spectral shape was very much
like the mental pictures he had visualized after
he had listened to the story of the pilot who had
cracked up because of a similar apparition.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then the real explanation flashed into his
mind.</p>

<p class='c004' >He gave a relieved laugh.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Hooray!” he cried in the still, dark cockpit
seat, “the ghost of the skies is explained.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“So it is!” agreed Scott, the pilot.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don’t—” began Chick; but his own words
died as he saw that they were not facing any
supernatural appearance.</p>

<p class='c004' >The light died out of the cloud as the
airplane, a lightly-built and fast-moving craft,
came steadily lower, closer. It was real!</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s Don!” said Garry, reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes, it is Don, all right,” agreed Chick, his
own fears gone.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry watched the light ship make its approach,
silent but genuine and then gave Chick
a brief lecture.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’m glad you came, after all—aren’t you?”
he remarked. “Now you can see for yourself
that every scare that seems to be started by
spooks is all in the way you judge what you
see.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s that way just this time,” admitted
Chick grudgingly. “The darkness, and the
swamp, and all the talk made me think I saw a
ghost ship coming out of a lighted cloud.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Certainly,” agreed Garry, “and you thought
that, because you heard somebody else say that
was how the ghost appeared. But it turns out
to be Don in the Dart, coming down out of the
sky just when the control man at the airport
had his searchlight switched on and turned it
past the clouds.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“For my part,” Scott informed the two
chums, “I don’t think the first crack-up happened
because the pilot saw a real ’bus.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I do,” argued Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >The talk ceased as the light ship came swiftly
down, across the marsh, dropping lower,
leveling off, setting its pontoon body lightly into
the water.</p>

<p class='c004' >If not as experienced, in point of years, as
Scott, the seventeen-year-old junior flyer at the
Dart’s controls was as expert. Landings in
daylight, night conditions, or in darkness, were
easy for Don: because of a season of timidity
concerning “getting down,” at the start of his
flying practice, the youth had determined to
break himself of his timidity before it interfered
with his rapid progress. Alone in his
uncle’s Dart, he had made practice take-offs
and landings in every sort of weather and under
all imaginable conditions, until he was so sure
of his ship that he had no uneasiness about
setting down. He realized that the modern airplane
is so well stabilized, so well designed,
that it does just what its pilot wants it to do—that
in every case where some part has not
failed, the pilot’s mental condition and its
resulting reaction on the handling of the ship is
what makes the difference between safe flying
and accidents that result in injury or worse.</p>

<p class='c004' >The small, wide-winged craft sent out a split
crest of foam, coming swiftly closer to the
Dragonfly; but it lost speed and Don maneuvered
it to a point close alongside the larger
craft and with his own wings just a little
behind those of the biplane. Gliding up to its
stop, the Dart rested quietly in the still, rather
murky water.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Hello!” its pilot greeted the others. “Did I
give you a solution of the Mystery of Mystery
Airport!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You certainly did!” Garry admitted. “Chick
thought you were the flying phantom——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Just as the first pilot to crash thought some
chance ship, lighted up by a flash of some
beacon, was the ghost,” Don interrupted.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’m not so sure of that,” Scott spoke, taking
up the thread of a statement he had been
about to make before the Dart came down. “I’ve
been interested in the mystery—I like spooks,
you know——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“More than I do!” broke in Chick, gloomily.
Scott, laughing, agreed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Every fellow to his taste,” he quoted. “Anyhow,
I’ve been reading up on ghosts, and talking
to some of the ‘old inhabitants’ around the
marsh. Want to know what I dug up?”</p>

<p class='c004' >All three eagerly chorused agreement.
“Away back in the days when airplanes were
tricky to handle and the pilots knew less about
aerodynamics than they do today,” he stated, “a
flyer was over this swamp, on just about this
sort of night,” he indicated the clustered, slow-moving,
fleecy groups of clouds, some assuming
the pyramid shape of thunderheads, “one
of the clam-diggers at the edge of the swamp
recalls it very plainly. He was out at low tide
after clams when—it happened!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“What!” asked Chick, forgetting his uneasiness
and the gloomy, spooky environment in his
suspense.</p>

<p class='c004' >The aviator had appeared suddenly, coming
down, through a cloud, as Scott repeated the
tale told him by an old man who earned his
meagre living with a clam-hoe and bucket; at
the same instant another ship, diving swiftly in
apparent oblivion of the first, came into view.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It must have happened in the flick of an eyelid,”
Scott went on. “As old Ike tells it, he
heard the engines, looked up, saw one ship for
a split second, saw the other, and then—saw
them come together!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh!” exclaimed Garry, “collided, did they!”
Scott completed his story quickly, after admitting
that Garry had diagnosed the accidental
smash correctly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Right-o! And they never found one of the
ships. It must have gone down in Devil’s Sink.”
He referred to a portion of the marsh either of
the quicksand bottom sort or very similar in
the softness of its muddy shallows. “And&mdash;-”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s—why they found—a skeleton, there!”
Chick shivered as he spoke in a hushed voice.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Maybe.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But—” Don objected, “what connection is
there between an accident years ago and the
excitement that has gotten into some of the
newspapers and made a reporter call our new
development ‘Mystery Airport?’”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Ever read the ‘Proceedings’ and other books
of the Society for Psychical Research?” Scott
questioned in turn.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I saw some of them in a bookstore,” Garry
admitted. “They were too dull and prosy for
me. Just old stories collected by scientific men
who were trying to find out whether ghosts
existed or not.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“What did they decide?” Chick spoke eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Nothing very definite,” Scott informed him.
“But I’ve gone over a lot of the dry ‘case-histories’
and I firmly believe that if somebody
has done something wrong, he has to haunt and
stay around the place.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Like a criminal ‘haunting’ the scene of his
crime,” chuckled Don. “I’m surprised at you,
Scott. I believe, in every case, if you could get
to the bottom of it you’d find that the ghost is
either produced by fraud, or else some perfectly
natural things are misjudged——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Chick thought you were the sky spook,”
broke in Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I believe that’s so in most of the cases,”
Scott agreed. “But this time I think the ghost
is restless, because he was careless in coming
along through the clouds where he couldn’t see
ahead far enough to be able to avoid other
ships—and he may have caused the other ship
to go down into the Sink. That makes his spirit
hang around, and of course whenever it appears,
it lives over all the terrible scenes of the
smash!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But I just proved—” began Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes, you proved that people can be
mistaken,” Scott was serious. “You didn’t prove
that any ship was near at the other times that
pilots have claimed they saw the ghost.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“One caught the fever from another,” argued
Garry. “The first one saw something—or he
tried to get out of culpability for carelessness
in making his crack-up, by saying a spook put
him out of control. The rest were all superstitious
and the story got headway. The next pilot
to see a flicker of Summer lightning and a bird
flying or anything at all, was quick to twist it
into a spectre, and come down to tell his story
and give everybody chills and shivers.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I think we’ll soon find out,” Scott spoke
quietly.</p>

<p class='c004' >Surprised, the others clamored for his reason.</p>

<p class='c004' >“This is just the sort of night that the three
other pilots had, when they claimed to see the
ghost of an airplane coming out of luminous
clouds,” Scott stated. “It’s close,
humid—storm-breeding July weather.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well, then, for another thing, if you check
up you’ll find that the spook has appeared every
seven days—and this is the seventh night since
this last time!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Let’s go home, Don,” whispered Chick,
across the narrow span of water. Don laughed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No, sirree!” he retorted. “In the first place,
if it is pure chance, nothing will happen, because
it isn’t reasonable that a beam of light from
the control room search-lamp would strike a
cloud every seventh night and four successive
weeks. Besides, it isn’t possible that an airplane
would be flying around just at the same time
that light came, and that no other ship would
be noticed.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No,” declared Garry. “My opinion is that
it’s some real person who flies out of the clouds,
after seeing a ship coming. Then he goes up
into another cloud and is lost, and because of
the first fib the pilot told to protect himself
from censure by the Board of Inquiry sitting
about the crack-up, all the rest believe they see
a spook.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I think he is trying to use the ghost scare
to drive business away from Uncle,” Don
asserted. “Uncle has several people he can name
who are none too fond of him. Any one of them
might be doing the ‘spooking.’”</p>

<p class='c004' >“In that case,” Garry was practical, “if we
go up, scouting, that person will know it, and
won’t ‘appear’ tonight.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s why I liked Scott’s plan when he
suggested guarding the sky,” Don agreed. “It’s
important, too—because Uncle Bruce is expecting
to get a big airline to contract for space for
its ships, servicing and all that, take-off and
landing, and fuel and oil. It will mean a lot to
him not to lose that contract. If we prevent any
‘spooking’ tonight, there won’t be any
newspaper scarehead stories tomorrow to make the
men hesitate about signing up.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Then let’s get up out of this stagnant
water!” urged Chick, fired by the realistic
explanation of the spectre. “We’ll be a sort of
Sky Watchman.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“An Airlane Guard!” suggested Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s it—an Airlane Guard!” Scott agreed.
“Well, come in here, Don, take this Dragonfly
aloft and cruise around. If you see signs of
any other ship than the mail ’plane—it’s due
soon—let Garry send over a green flare if it’s
in the air, or have Chick fire a red Verey if it
goes up off the earth or water—and you go
around on wingtip to point to it and start after
it, and I’ll come up on a slanting course, and we
can corner the fellow, and end the mystery of
the Spectre in the Clouds.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why not come up in the Dragonfly, and let
Don fly the Dart, too?” Garry suggested.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The Dragonfly isn’t fast. The Dart is. If
the ‘spook’ pilot sees you young lads cruising
around, he’ll think it’s just a joy-hop. If he
happened to see you start out—with me—he’ll
suppose we are testing the visibility of the new
airport lighting system—and he might try to
scare up a little excitement for us, as he’d suppose.
Then, if Don flew the Dart, taking off
first, to surprise him, the ‘spook’ might do
stunts and I’d rather be the one to handle the
Dart in the night time if stunting is in order.
As far as both ships flying around is concerned,
what self-respecting ghost, or sensible enemy
of Mr. McLeod’s, would give us a chance to
drive him down and capture him if he saw two
ships in the airlane waiting for him?”</p>

<p class='c004' >They saw the logic in his reasoning and
agreed to abide by Scott’s original plan.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Dragonfly was warmed up.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, in its pilot’s seat, waved a hand to Scott
who had shifted to the other craft, opened his
throttle carefully to avoid unnecessary air
disturbance as he drove away from the Dart, and
then got his pontoons “on the step,” so that
take-off would be easy, and lifted the three-place
Dragonfly into the night.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry felt a thrill of expectancy. He loved
the mysterious, but of the practical, worldly
brand; he had no belief in supernatural things.
This would be a chase against a human enemy
of Bruce McLeod, airport designer and airways
development specialist.
Don, steady but hopeful, felt much the same.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, for his part, snapped his safety belt
with a little tremble of his fingers. He anticipated
something fearful.</p>

<p class='c004' >His premonition was fulfilled.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c002'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />THE SPECTRE IN THE CLOUD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >“There it is!——”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick’s voice, shrill with terror, died away,
and Don, startled for an instant, almost let the
glide become a dive; but he caught his stick and
gunned ahead, giving up the glide they had been
in.</p>

<p class='c004' >The radial engine, though of as silent a type
as any, drowned any reply from Garry or Don
until the youthful pilot, climbing, had gained a
good thousand feet more of altitude. Then he
cut the gun and let the glide begin, so that the
Dart was quietly nose-low in a gentle glide.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don’t go off at half-cock that way,” he
remonstrated.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No!” Garry was a trifle annoyed by Chick’s
impetuous screeches. “If you insist on yelling
‘wolf!’ every time the sheet lightning flickers
on the clouds, you’d better be put down—and
stop trying to be an airlane guard.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Was it sheet lightning?” Chick asked
lamely.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes. There’s a storm brewing.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Then we’d better go home!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don’t be so anxious.” Garry spoke sharply.
“The storm isn’t here and won’t be for an hour.
We’re going to stay aloft at least till the mail
’plane comes in. They ’re inaugurating the new
ship-to-shore service and you wouldn’t want to
be making a pass at the field just when that
crate comes over, and make him lose ten
minutes waiting for us to shoot the field and land
and get the ship off the runway.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don climbed again.</p>

<p class='c004' >That cruise, however, began to be tedious.
Already they had been for a good half hour aloft,
cruising to and fro, mostly over the dismal, dark
reaches of the salt marsh.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don chose to stick quite closely over the area
which had been the scene of one real mishap and
several other narrowly averted crashes.</p>

<p class='c004' >The spectre had always appeared over the
swamp.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I wish they’d start draining it,” Don mused,
thinking of the gloomy marsh below his trucks.
“Those engineers spend so much time
surveying! If they’d get their men out there, and
start work, there’d soon be no dark place close
to the airport, and the ghost would go away.
Or—if anybody should be trying to ruin Uncle
Bruce’s new real estate development and the
airport business, they’d see it was no use and
quit!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Having nothing to occupy his mind, as he
kept the Dart almost automatically at flying
speed and in level flight or climbing for a
subsequent glide, the youth, depending on Garry
and Chick for their first inkling of anything
unusual, reviewed the strange mysteries which had
upset the morale not only of the airport
personnel and of the pilots, but of the residents of
Port Washington and the vicinity, as well.</p>

<p class='c004' >Four weeks before, to the day, just before the
dedication of the new airport which had been
opened in conjunction with the already
established seaplane base and aircraft plant, an
airplane had cracked up in the swamp. It had
approached, down wind, over the morass that lay
where the draining project would later bring
airport expansion and a cottage community.
Since the full night-landing light equipment had
not been completed, at the newly dedicated field,
no provision had been made at that time for
night landings and so no one had been on watch
for the free-lance airplane which had gone
down.</p>

<p class='c004' >Its pilot had not been badly hurt and had
managed to attract rescuers by use of flares.</p>

<p class='c004' >His story, told that night, and later persisted
in at the Inquiry Board investigation of the
smash, had been a weird one.</p>

<p class='c004' >It had fired the superstitious air folks to hear
him affirm that he had been making his approach
to try out the new field, quietly, when a sudden
glow of light in a cloud almost dead ahead of
his nose, only a scant few feet higher, had
startled him.</p>

<p class='c004' >Almost at the same instant, as he maintained
in his assertion, from within the glowing cloud
he had seen the swift approach of a shape.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It was an airplane, but it wasn’t an
airplane!” he had maintained, declaring that its
shape was blurred, its outlines ghostly, its
position seemingly also to shake up and down, as
though either the ship was vibrating dreadfully
or its very shape of terror made the moist cloud
stuff shudder.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It seemed to be coming down and straight
at me!” the pilot had declared. “I got just the
glimpse—then I dived, and of course my engine
was full gun and I power-dived and only came
out of it just above the marsh.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Then he had added the finishing, terrifying
word.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I looked up, to see what had become of that
other ’bus, and—the sky was silent, deserted,
dark!”</p>

<p class='c004' >On each of the succeeding seventh days, as
Don recalled, a pilot had set down, shaken and
horrified, to report seeing a similar apparition
of the skies, a very phantom coming out of
clouds!</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s all imagination!” Don murmured,
reflectively. “One caught the scare from the
other!——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don!——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“There!—side-slip! Quick!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, catching the fright if not the sense of
Chick’s scream, and the surprise of Garry’s
order, kicked rudder to give the banked Dart,
making a gentle circuit of the swamp, a chance
to shift downward and sideways.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then he glanced to his left: common sense
told him that the bank with left wingtip
elevated, causing the slip to the right, and Garry’s
consequent order meant that whatever gave rise
to the order was to his left and slightly higher.
He looked that way.</p>

<p class='c004' >Just before a brightening shimmer of
Summer lightning blotted out the spectacle, Don
saw what made his flesh crawl.</p>

<p class='c004' >Apparently lighting up a large, fluffy,
steamy-white cloud with its own spectral glow, some
phantom ship came fleetly forth through that
misty, white screen.</p>

<p class='c004' >Dark, almost black, yet not distinct and sharp,
because of the mist he supposed, that mystical,
phantasmic craft grew large—and was blotted
from view by the bright flash of the distant
storm.</p>

<p class='c004' >Gone! Absolutely vanished! Once seen, for
a bare instant, the strange and ghostly mirage
had disappeared when the blaze of the lightning
faded.</p>

<p class='c004' >Immediately Garry, cool and self-contained,
sent over the side a parachute-flare, self-igniting
with the jerk as the ’chute opened to sustain
the vivid, unearthly light in mid-sky, slowly
dropping.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick cowered. Garry remained erect, calm,
poised, staring swiftly above, to either side, and
below.</p>

<p class='c004' >He saw nothing. Slightly blinded by the
recent flash of Summer electricity, and still
being a little dazzled by the green of the flare that
had ignited almost in front of him, he could not
make out any distinct object in any direction.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, who had been looking down at his
inclinometer to gauge his bank as he glided, just
when the cries first came, was not dazzled: he
sent a swift, questing look in every direction.</p>

<p class='c004' >The sky was blank, except for the after-flare
of the dying electrical discharge and the
growing glare of the green light.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But—was that still the shadow of the spook
’plane, that I just saw?” he muttered, inquiring
of his straining eyes. If so, the barely discerned
shadow was gone.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t see Scott!” he shouted back to
Chick. “Do you?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, speechless, shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He’s probably up above the clouds by this
time!” called Garry; he knew how fast was the
Dart. Probably, as he reasoned it, the watching
pilot had seen the light in the clouds before the
green flare had gone over the side. Its blaze
had prevented their dimmed light from
discerning the Dart, that was all.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There comes the mail ’plane!” cried Don,
waving an arm toward the North. Down the
Sound, bringing the mail from a vessel still a
hundred miles from land, the swift ’plane was
seeking to prove the commercial advisability of
lopping off delays in getting trans-oceanic mail
to its destination.</p>

<p class='c004' >They watched the fleet approach of the small
ship that had been catapulted from a huge
liner’s cabin deck.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Look!” Chick’s voice was shrill.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry even, caught his breath. Unexpectedly,
like the vision of a fantastic nightmare, Don
also saw the catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c004' >Sharply, parallel with their own course, the
mail ’plane tipped down its nose.</p>

<p class='c004' >Before it, a luminous cloud seemed to glow
with a weird, unearthly light.</p>

<p class='c004' >Down went the mail craft—into darkness—into
the bay.</p>

<p class='c004' >Sharply Don slapped his stick sidewise,
kicking rudder. On wingtip he banked around,
straightened, gave his engine full gun, elevating
the nose, darting straight for that cloud. Still
it seemed to glow!</p>

<p class='c004' >On a full-gun climb Don made his ship climb
at that cloud.</p>

<p class='c004' >The glow disappeared.</p>

<p class='c004' >Straight through the cloud he drove—and
came out!</p>

<p class='c004' >Except for their ship, immersed in that
humid, wet mist for an instant, the cloud had
been devoid of any tangible object. No other
ship, hiding by some miracle of skilful piloting,
had been there to dodge, to reveal itself in
escaping Don’s intrepid charge.</p>

<p class='c004' >Out of the cloud they sped.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don cast his eyes backward. The fluff, hardly
disturbed except for a swirl of fleecy smoke
where their propeller had moiled up the edge
of the filmy drapery, lay at the tail.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh-h-h!” Again, almost inarticulate, Chick
screamed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Dive!”</p>

<p class='c004' >As he cried out, Garry realized that his call
was useless—late!</p>

<p class='c004' >Straight ahead of the Dragonfly’s speeding,
climbing nose, in one more of those horrible,
mistily glowing banks of Summer moisture, lit
as if with a phantom’s phosphorescent fire, their
horrified eyes saw a vision, dreadful,
inescapable!</p>

<p class='c004' >Two misty, shadowy airplanes, appearing as
though silhouetted in shuddering brown against
the gleaming of some infernal light, came at one
another.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don knew that his ship could not avoid
adding its own crash to that cataclysmic impact.</p>

<p class='c004' >There was not time to dive.</p>

<p class='c004' >Already the propeller was within a hundred
feet of the others!</p>

<p class='c004' >Don closed his eyes, braced.</p>

<p class='c004' >Mechanically he had depressed the nose by
throwing forward the stick.</p>

<p class='c004' >But there was no rip and rend of wings
stripped off as they went under the trucks of
those other airplanes.</p>

<p class='c004' >There was nothing—neither impact nor blow,
crash nor other sound.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don looked swiftly upward.</p>

<p class='c004' >The cloud was around them—dim—silent—ghostly!
And dark!</p>

<p class='c004' >And the other ships—had they dived, fallen?
Or, were they but the phantoms of
over-stimulated imagination?</p>

<p class='c004' >They had come together—but Don realized
that he had heard no crash.</p>

<p class='c004' >Hastily he pulled out of the dive. Soberly
he turned the nose toward Mystery
Airport—baffled—not knowing what to think, what to
believe!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c002'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />TEMPEST AND TREACHERY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Seeing the direction taken by Don, Garry,
using the light of the ever increasing flashes
in the North, scribbled rapidly and sent a bit
of paper forward.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Going back?” he asked Don in that fashion.</p>

<p class='c004' >As a vivid blaze of forked lightning leaped
across the sky, Don nodded.</p>

<p class='c004' >For answer Garry extended his arm, outward
and downward.</p>

<p class='c004' >The green flare, floating slowly downward, lit
up the swamp beneath the Dragonfly.</p>

<p class='c004' >Looking down, Don saw what Garry meant.
The mail ’plane lay in a tangled heap of marsh
grass at the edge of the lighted space. A flash
of lightning picked it out more sharply.</p>

<p class='c004' >In that more accented glimpse Don made out
the twisted wings and warped outlines. For a
moment the more sinister apparition which had
menaced the three chums had driven the pilot of
the mail ship out of Don’s mind.</p>

<p class='c004' >He felt ashamed of his lack of consideration
for a man whose airplane had gone down so
swiftly.
He swung back and began to drop the nose.</p>

<p class='c004' >The floating flare died out.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, still searching the skies for that
dreadful phantom whose advent had robbed him of
all self-control and whose unexplainable
disappearance had added to, rather than diminished
his terror, cried out in dismay. He wanted
very much to get among people, to feel the
security of human companionship among older
people.</p>

<p class='c004' >Almost at once, however, Chick’s sense of
decency came to his rescue. He was glad that
his remonstrating call had not been heard
because of the noise made by the engine. At heart
Chick had, like most impulsive youths, one of
the kindest, most chivalrous, natures.</p>

<p class='c004' >Resolutely he drove out his own selfish
timidity, braced himself to ignore the shaking of
his nerves and muscles.</p>

<p class='c004' >In the glare of a bright stream of heavenly
fire, Don turned a face that showed great
concern.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry guessed the reason.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Summer tempest, that had been
prophesied by heat, humidity and the gathering
thunder heads, was bearing down swiftly from
the North, racing along the shore of the Sound.</p>

<p class='c004' >Its rapid approach gave Don much
uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c004' >Wind, rain and turbulent wrench of storm
could be avoided by going at once to the
airport. They could set down, get the Dragonfly
in the hangar, and get help to proceed by safer
ways to the rescue of the pilot.</p>

<p class='c004' >If they tried to set down in the water of the
marsh, the storm might break upon them before
they could rescue the fallen pilot, always
supposing that they could get him out of his ship.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, scribbling another note, passed it up.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don read it in the next flicker of the
intermittent lightning.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It is dangerous to try to go down. But his
life may hang on quick aid.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, reading what Garry had written,
nodded, kept the nose down, added a spurt of
the gun to be sure of clear cylinders, and then
side-slipped to lose altitude as quickly as he
could. He brought the ship to a level once
more, and, while Chick sent over white landing
flares to help him chose his landing without risk,
made contact with the water.</p>

<p class='c004' >While the Dragonfly sped with diminishing
momentum across the wide stretch of water they
had formerly used, Chick and Garry were busy.</p>

<p class='c004' >From a conveniently located small locker
Chick drew out and uncoiled rope with which to
secure the Dragonfly if they were not able to
go aloft and escape the storm. If they had to
“ride it out” he wished to be able to stake
down the wings and tail, to prepare the ship
as well as possible against the tear and stress
of high winds. He hoped that the airplane
would run close to the edge of the open water.
There, he knew, was a small dock, on the
widened end of which stood a small, two-room shack
used by a boatman who rented his small dories
for crabbing excursions into the channels of
the swamp.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, with quick hands, drew out a first aid
kit from a pocket in his cockpit, glancing into
its box to assure himself that it contained the
liniments, bandages and adhesives he might
need. Garry had taken a number of lessons in
first aid and instinctively thought of the work
of mercy he might be called upon to do.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, maneuvering the Dragonfly up to as
close proximity to the old dock as the safety of
wings and propeller would allow, signaled to
Chick and called for one more white flare.</p>

<p class='c004' >Dropping the floating light into the water, to
augment for them the illumination provided
by the almost incessant flickers of lightning,
Chick sprang up, and began to climb out on a
brace and the wing-step at one side while Don
balanced him on the other.</p>

<p class='c004' >Expertly Don caught the rope end.</p>

<p class='c004' >It was plainly to be seen that the storm would
be down upon them before they could take off
safely and get high enough to avoid the moiling
currents of the stormy area.
Bringing the ship as close to the dock as he
could, by flinging a bight of the rope over a dock
piling, Don let the wind drift its tail outward.
Chick, on his side, clambered carefully forward
across the lower wing until he could fling his
part of the rope over another wooden upright.</p>

<p class='c004' >Quickly, but carefully, they worked the ship
around so that it was sheltered somewhat by
the dock planking and to the leeward of the
old house.</p>

<p class='c004' >By climbing out to the wingtip, gingerly so
as not to injure the fabric and with each
movement setting his weight on the supporting
framework, Chick, his terrors forgotten in
action, held a flying wire with one hand, bent far
outward, and managed to get his fingers over
the gunwale of a dory tied under the wharf.</p>

<p class='c004' >He drew against the pull of the wind until he
could get the dory and the low wingtip close
enough together to enable him to step across.</p>

<p class='c004' >Swiftly he untied the painter of the boat while
Garry aided Don to use every available inch
of their rope in securing the Dragonfly against
the pull and thrust of wind, the tossing waves
that must soon fling the ship to and fro.</p>

<p class='c004' >Their tasks completed, Don and Garry, one
on the wharf planks, the other balancing the
light flying craft, waited until Chick could scull
the dory close alongside the fuselage.</p>

<p class='c004' >There he stepped back onto the wing bracing,
steadying the dory as Garry and Don entered it.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Hang on!” he urged, as Don caught a
bracing wire to keep the two craft together, using
his hand to fend off the rub of wood against
the Dragonfly’s fabric body. “I’ll break into
the shack and get oars.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Agile, supple, quick, Chick clambered to the
planks.</p>

<p class='c004' >He ran around the small building, old,
dilapidated, weather-worn.</p>

<p class='c004' >The door, he recalled from earlier visits, was
toward the more solid shore a hundred yards
beyond, from which a narrow runway enabled
visitors to cross deep, mud-bottomed channels.</p>

<p class='c004' >To Chick’s surprise, the door stood ajar!</p>

<p class='c004' >He dashed in, waited until a flash of the
swiftly coming electrical storm gave him light,
located the racks of oars at one side, secured a
pair and hurried out.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Take flares!” he urged. “You might need
to signal. I’ll stay here!” He was anxious to
make amends for his earlier weakness by
braving the storm, guarding the Dragonfly as best
he could, in spite of the spooky look of that
open door of the deserted interior of the shack.</p>

<p class='c004' >Agreeing, as soon as they had secured the
signal lights, Don and Garry sculled for all they
were worth, got the dory away from the
airplane, and then took their places, rowing hard
for the stricken shape of the mail ’plane half
way down the Southern shore.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick hastily went from post to post, making
certain that their knotted ropes were secure.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then he turned back to the old hovel.</p>

<p class='c004' >Hoarse and angry, the thunder rumbled, ever
louder.</p>

<p class='c004' >Across the water, in the dying light of the
last flare they had ignited, he could see Don
and Garry, their bodies rising and bending in
rapid rhythms as they put all their strength
behind the oars on their rescue errand.</p>

<p class='c004' >The door of the shack, when Chick came to
it again, stood as before.</p>

<p class='c004' >He hurried in.</p>

<p class='c004' >The wind began to blow in short, sharp puffs.
A vivid fork of light thrust its fire from cloud
to earth. A crash and rumble followed.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick shivered; but it was not from fear of
the storm.</p>

<p class='c004' >Somewhere within that small boathouse came
a low moan! Hollow, hard to locate, it chilled
Chick’s very marrow.</p>

<p class='c004' >He braced his shaken nerves, standing just
inside the doorway, his presence hidden from
peering eyes by some old oilskins behind which
he had hurriedly dodged.</p>

<p class='c004' >A glare of burning air, a blue-white bolt of
fire, threw the inside of the place into
brightness akin to day.</p>

<p class='c004' >In that flash Chick’s eyes caught the huddle
of a body in a corner.</p>

<p class='c004' >At first terrified, then made calm by the
thought that it must be the mail ’plane pilot
who had managed to crawl along the swamp
edge to shelter in the old place and needed
instant attention, Chick crossed the room.</p>

<p class='c004' >As he did so a glare of light more vivid than
the others showed him for a fleeting instant the
face of the man lying in a heap.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Doc Morgan!” Chick cried out in
amazement. “Doc”——</p>

<p class='c004' >The man was a sort of general helper around
the airport, not very keen of wit, nor deft of
hand; he aided when ships had to be trundled
out of the hangar, and swept up the yards, and
did other odd jobs.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Doc” had earned his nickname because he
was always gathering herbs which he
maintained were of great medicinal value. Curiously
enough, the concoctions he administered to the
amused airport personnel often proved to be
very helpful. Therefore “Doc” was forgiven his
dull wit and liked for his good nature.</p>

<p class='c004' >But what was he doing there, in the
supposably untenanted boat shack?</p>

<p class='c004' >Morgan stirred, groaned. Chick bent down,
“‘Doc’—are you hurt?”</p>

<p class='c004' >The man stirred again, and then Chick, with
a stare, moved back a step. The man was
muttering. An empty bottle, reeking as did his
breath with the odor of cheap alcohol, gave the
clue to his condition.</p>

<p class='c004' >A fierce gust of wind swept through the place
before it banged the door against its frame
with a crash that made Chick jump. Before the
slam of the door shut out the fire of a bolt that
came close, Chick saw a bit of paper caught up
by the draft and sent through the air. He ran
to the door, threw it wide, turned, and,
waiting for the next gust, and its accompanying
flash, he located the paper—secured it—caught
sight of its marked surface, thin, inked lines on
light tracing paper—and cried out, in disgust.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You traitor! You’ve taken some of the plans
for the new all-metal ship! This is one! Where
are the others?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c002'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />STORM-TOSSED WINGS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Puffs of cool wind began to bend the tall
grass while Don and Garry bent and pulled back
at the dory’s oars.</p>

<p class='c004' >Rapidly the intensity of fitful flashes in the
North increased, and the storm drew closer.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Think we can make it?” gasped Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Hope so!” Don responded over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004' >Ahead of them, but fully exposed to the blast
of the coming tempest, lightning flashes revealed
the torn, broken shape of the mail ’plane. If
they could get there before the storm broke in
its full fury they might rescue its pilot from the
added menace of turbulent waters.</p>

<p class='c004' >Already, while they were a quarter of a mile
away, they saw that the time was all too short.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don!” called Garry, “I thought I saw a sort
of path on the shore, along the water, when the
lightning came that last time.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I thought this was all marshy, soft ground,”
commented Don, “but it might be that we could
get around to the mail crate quicker if there was
solid earth to run on. Let’s try!”</p>

<p class='c004' >They let the increasing wind drift them,
aiding their efforts.</p>

<p class='c004' >Bright and fierce, a flare of electric blue came
across the sky. In its light they made out what
looked like fairly firm earth, running in a
swiftly narrowing strip from the mainland, a
promontory jutting in a curving line into the
grass-covered waters. If only that jut of land
extended far enough they thought it possible to
reach the smashed airplane by a safer route
than the dory could afford. Already it dipped
and rolled, as they drove its nose on the wash of
foam into the soft bank between the grasses.</p>

<p class='c004' >Holding tightly to a handful of the sturdy
vegetation, Don began to progress into the bow.
From the windward side Garry dug his oar into
soft bottom, steadying their craft as well as he
could.</p>

<p class='c004' >The wind swept the stern around into the
grass, but Don managed to get a leg over the
bow, to test the firmness of the bank.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I think it’s solid enough to hold us,” he
cried, and got out of the dory, being careful to
cling to the rope at the prow, lest his chum be
drifted beyond the patch of solid ground,
separating them and leaving Garry to battle alone
against the surge of wind and water.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s safe!” Don added. “I’ll hold the painter,
Garry. Come on. Be careful to leave the oars
in the bottom or the grass might pull them out
of the boat.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I will!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry picked up his first aid kit, stowed the
oars, crawled forward and tumbled to a
yielding sod which, nevertheless, did not break
through.</p>

<p class='c004' >Guiding themselves by the steadily
increasing succession of lightning gleams, their voices
drowned in the quickly following growls of
thunder, wondering about the Dragonfly, about
Scott, probably aloft in the Dart, Don and
Garry went from the dory, tied to a root, along
a perilous and unknown path.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, in the van, had to part clumps of
tossing, cumbering grass to test the solidity of
footing before he went ahead; Garry, clutching his
kit and steadying his partner when a foot would
miss the sometimes narrow band of safe path,
followed.</p>

<p class='c004' >As a glare of vivid fire, followed almost
instantly by a peal of angry thunder, revealed
the upthrust wing of the smashed craft within
a few feet, to one side, Don stopped.</p>

<p class='c004' >It had been apparent to them for several
yards, as they parted the clumps of grass, that
the way went no further.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Can you lift me up, make a ‘back’ for me,
do you think?” Garry asked as he carefully put
down the first aid kit on the path they had just
traversed.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, choosing his stand on what seemed to
be the firmest spot—an old spar or block of
driftwood embedded in the mud—bent forward,
his hands braced on his knees. Lithely, with his
gymnasium training to give him confidence,
Garry put his weight on the elevated perch of
Don’s back and leaped, forward, upward and
outward, over the mud and water, as a chain of
fiery light split the clouds to the roar of
thunder.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, in that vivid flare, saw the lithe figure
seemingly poised between sky and water, its
outflung hands seeking for a grip on the leading
edge of the wing that was closest to them.</p>

<p class='c004' >Leaping up as soon as the weight left his
supporting back, Don saw those hands strike
their target—but the light died as it seemed to
him that Garry slipped. Peals of celestial
cannon drowned a cry if there was any. With eyes
still blinded by the fierceness of the last flash,
Don could not make out whether Garry had been
able to hold his grip or if he struggled in ooze
and quagmire, sinking, helpless.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Garry!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c004' >From the North came another blaze of
blue-white light.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don gave a relieved cry. Garry, one foot
braced against the junction of fuselage and
flying wire, one hand clinging to the wire, was
safe!</p>

<p class='c004' >The moiled waters, reflecting the furious
discharges of fire from above, were foaming across
under the wind’s whip, and Don saw that if
Garry did not find the object of his search
quickly, it would be too late. Already the salty
spume lashed his face, the fabric of the
airplane quivered and shook to the beat of waves,
and sunk in the soft mud, while wind under the
wing failed to topple the whole craft onto the
end of the promontory only because its trucks
lay in clinging mud and steadied the ship.</p>

<p class='c004' >From across the end of the grassy bank
Don saw the distant glow of two red flares,
smoking and guttering in the wind.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick was signaling. Two red flares!—did
that mean the air signal, for an airplane to land,
the storm call “proceed no further!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Or, Don wondered, was Chick himself in
danger?</p>

<p class='c004' >“I can’t go!” he muttered. “Oh, Garry—hurry!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, revealed by a fresh, and even more
vivid stream of heavenly fire, was lifting
something.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don saw him wave, as if urging him to go
away.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then something heavy seemed to come
against him, almost taking him off his feet.
Instinctively he clutched it, recovering his footing.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The mail sack!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c004' >In the next vivid flash Garry came, hand over
hand, along the edge of the wing as the whole
ship toppled forward, and the change of angle,
freeing its trucks from the mud, enabled the
wind to get under the wings with telling effect.</p>

<p class='c004' >As Don steadied Garry after his drop to the
ground, the lightning showed the menace of the
toppling airplane.</p>

<p class='c004' >Backward they leaped, Don with the heavy
sack of precious mail.</p>

<p class='c004' >Just missing them, the wing came down, the
fuselage rested for a moment on the
supporting earth and then earth, craft and all tumbled
and torn by the wind, slipped on into deeper
mud beyond the solid earth left just a foot
beyond Garry’s toes.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Let’s get back!” gasped Garry, shaken.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But the pilot?——” began Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He wasn’t there!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don realized, as they turned to retrace the
Way, that the pilot could have had time, scant
but sufficient, to leap clear in a back-pack ’chute
and that it would be impossible for them to
comb the marsh for him in the rapidly coming
blackness, wind and rain.</p>

<p class='c004' >As rapidly as they could, finally breaking into
a run when they got clear of the most
dangerous and slippery end of the promontory, Don
and Garry raced toward the beckoning flares.</p>

<p class='c004' >Carrying the mail pouch, impeded by it as it
caught on the restraining grasses, Don followed
Garry. Garry, his eyes straining, tried to
detect the figure of Chick by their guiding light,
but he saw no figure!</p>

<p class='c004' >As they came into the clear space near the
boathouse, with wind whipping the first flecks
of rain into their faces to add its cold warning
to the sting of salt spray torn from the
growing crests of waves, Don and Garry paused,
almost stunned.</p>

<p class='c004' >The last ruddy glow of the flares, and the
white fires almost constantly leaping across the
zenith, showed them two forms emerging from
the door of the hovel, toward the planks that
led across the marsh to solid ground.</p>

<p class='c004' >They were struggling. They were locked
together. One was large, the other small and
slight.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Chick!” yelled Don, putting speed to his
flying feet.</p>

<p class='c004' >The flares died. In a glare of light the larger
figure broke free from the smaller as they came
to the boarding.</p>

<p class='c004' >The lightning died out, leaving the sky a
black, thunder-echoing void. The earth beneath
was cloaked in the pall. With blinded eyes Don
stopped, fearing to crash into Garry just ahead
of him.</p>

<p class='c004' >They were too far away to see, in that
masking blackness, what had happened.</p>

<p class='c004' >The last light had shown the smaller figure
reeling backward, on the edge of the planks, it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c004' >There was nothing to do! To run forward
might mean being precipitated into the marshy
channels.</p>

<p class='c004' >They waited for the next flash.</p>

<p class='c004' >With the perversity of storms, the lightning
seemed exhausted for a long, mind-torturing
moment. When next it flared up, two anxious
hearts seemed to drop like leaden weights from
two tight throats where they had striven to
constrict the breath.</p>

<p class='c004' >Bare and silent lay the narrow footway across
the marsh.</p>

<p class='c004' >Dark and sinister the water moiled in the
channels beneath it.</p>

<p class='c004' >Thick and brooding, the heavy grass bent
and seemed to whisper mockingly in the wind.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Garry!—where did Chick go?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don—I don’t know! I can’t see!”</p>

<p class='c004' >They ran forward while the light lasted.</p>

<p class='c004' >The next flashes gave them light to get to the
edge of the footway over the marsh. They stared
toward the grass, the water, the bare and
unrevealing planks.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick was not visible. Neither was his
adversary.</p>

<p class='c004' >Beyond the end of the planks the grass began
again. Don dropped the mail pouch: Garry,
his kit forgotten, deserted far behind them in
the eel grass at the promontory end, ran across
the planks. Into the hovel Don turned.</p>

<p class='c004' >On the narrow, twisting path beyond the
planks Garry searched, unable to see far
because the grass stood so high.</p>

<p class='c004' >In the hut, with wind roaring around it, Don
strained his eyes to gain some truth from the
upset table, the overturned lantern, the
evidences of strife and of struggle that the
lightning showed as its fire came leaping again
through the doorway.</p>

<p class='c004' >Quickly Garry retraced his steps to be met
on the planking by Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There has been a fight!” cried Don. “Did
you find anybody—see anything?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No!” answered Don, “but—listen!”</p>

<p class='c004' >As the thunder reverberated and echoed,
followed by a deep silence, pounding feet came
along the path they had recently used, from the
promontory. They turned, staring into the
South, the light coming at their backs from the
sky fires.</p>

<p class='c004' >A man in a pilot’s helmet and jacket,
corduroy trousers and high boots, running in a
staggering, uneven course, with an arm
swinging limp at his side, hailed them.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Help!——”</p>

<p class='c004' >The figure stopped, wavering, and crumpled
on the earth.</p>

<p class='c004' >Swiftly Don and Garry ran to the man who
lay prone on the sod.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh!” he moaned, and then, recovering
slightly, he gasped, “can you get me
to—doctor?—hurt—inside!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s the mail ’plane pilot!” cried Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >He saw his duty, and there was scant time
in which to do it.</p>

<p class='c004' >The first winged cohorts of the storm clouds
had broken to shreds overhead. Its first fury
was expended. From the North came the
gathering furies of its second, and more terrible
onslaught.</p>

<p class='c004' >If Don could get that Dragonfly into the
air and climb out of the turbulent area, he could
get the pilot to some medical man; at the same
time he might carry on that mail!—and send
searchers to find Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >Much depended on the safe delivery of the
pouch Garry had recovered. It was the first
of what might be a successful series of
ship-to-shore mail flights, from vast ocean greyhounds,
in swift airplanes. Its successful delivery meant
a great future for Don’s uncle who had started
the idea with the inception of his new airport.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes!” Don cried, bidding Garry help him to
lift the pilot to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004' >To get that tethered airplane, the Dragonfly,
started, warmed up and aloft, carrying pilot and
mail, was his immediate concern.</p>

<p class='c004' >Ably Garry aided him.</p>

<p class='c004' >Before the fury of the storm broke again,
their storm-tossed wings cut the air, climbing
swiftly through the darkness that seemed
breathlessly waiting, still ominous,
waiting—while Don flew his best.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then, from the North, the storm furies
leaped.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c002'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />“THE THING THAT NEVER WAS”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Stunned by the realization that the man who
worked around the airport seemed to have
betrayed those who trusted him, clinging to the
roll of tracing paper that was his evidence of
that betrayal, Chick faced Doc Morgan in the
dark hovel until the next flash of celestial fire
showed him a lantern standing on the small,
rickety table at one side.</p>

<p class='c004' >Hastening over to the table Chick fumbled on
it, and in the drawer which remained partially
open.</p>

<p class='c004' >He found a card of paper matches.</p>

<p class='c004' >Quickly lifting the lantern slide and turning
up the wick, Chick ignited a match, applied it
to the burner and adjusted his light.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Listen here—” Doe Morgan, in his corner,
struggled up to a sitting posture, groaned again
and then took up his own refutation of Chick’s
accusation. “Listen, Chick! I ain’t a traitor,
no such thing I ain’t!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Turning, in the feeble glow of the lantern as
its wick burned with a queer, fitful light, Chick’s
face showed his antagonism and unbelief.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No, sir,” the man contended, “Doc Morgan,
he may be ‘queer’ but he ain’t no such a thing
as a traitor, not him!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Look at this!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick waved the rolled tracing.</p>

<p class='c004' >“——And this!” He indicated the overturned
bottle that reeked of alcohol of the cheapest
kind, lying on its side at the edge of the table.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You thought you’d celebrate getting away
with the plans of the new all-metal ship, and
nobody would know about it, off here in the
marsh!” Chick accused Morgan fiercely.
Treachery was hateful to Chick. The man had been
allowed to stay around the aircraft building
plant and the new airport because he was a
harmless sort of scatter-brain, able to do simple
chores, willing enough, and always “doctoring”
people with his herb remedies, coming to the
swamps for the peculiar forms of sea grasses
and weed that he contended had medicinal value.
He had been trusted.</p>

<p class='c004' >“How can you say you aren’t a traitor?”
Chick challenged, motioning with the paper he
clutched, keeping the table between himself and
the man he no longer trusted, watchful, alert,
angry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What’s that, you got there?” asked Doc,
making an effort to get to his feet. He fell
back, groaning, and Chick, in some surprise,
noted that there was a handkerchief made into
a rude bandage about his head.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You know, well enough!” Chick spoke
through the rumble and thud of thunder whose
echoes reminded him of heavy cannon balls
rolling along on cleats fastened to an inclined
trough, as thunder was simulated in the local
motion picture house for one of its “sound
effects.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I never saw that, what you got, no I never!”
declared Doc. “Here I come in the swamp, I do,
for salt water weed to mix my herbs, and I see
a storm coming fast, I do, and shelter here.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s good!” scoffed Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s truth, it is so! I come here, I do, and—”
his face, in the spectral yellow gleams from the
lantern, and the contrasting glare of
intermittent lightning showing through the door, looked
pale and weird, “—and I see—something I
never thought I’d see outside of a nightmare,
so I do——”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick’s attention was arrested.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What do you mean,” he demanded. “‘See
what you wouldn’t see outside of a nightmare!’
What is that!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I can’t tell you, that I can’t! It was—too
awful!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Quickly Chick recovered from his momentary
dismay. The man was trying to divert him
from his accusation, he decided.</p>

<p class='c004' >He made a gesture toward the emptied bottle.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s what made you see whatever you
think you saw!” he declared.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No!” Doc got slowly and unsteadily to his
feet. Chick watched. “No,” Doc reiterated, “I
never touched that till after I saw—It! I come
in here, I did, I declare—to shelter. Then I
saw—It. It was in the corner, and I saw it, I did so!
Terrible, it was! Green in the hair, and green
in the face! And greenish hands! And all
slimy and terrible, like it had come up out of the
ooze, it was so!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick crushed back his tendency to believe,
and to be startled.</p>

<p class='c004' >“After—you’d emptied that!” he insisted,
gesturing toward the old bottle.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No! No such thing. I knocked that over.
It set there, it did, and I hit it, I jumped so. I
hit the table, and I must either of got upset
stumbling over my own feet or—It—hit me!
That’s when I took that—what was left in the
bottle, to steady me, I did so!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, disgusted, unwilling to be hoodwinked,
realizing that he had more important things to
consider, refused to listen any longer.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Dragonfly lay tied to the wharf piling:
the wind was rising. His chums were off in the
dark waters of the swamp on a rescue errand.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I can’t bother with you,” he snapped. “Tell
it to Don’s uncle, when we get out of this.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Doc remained silent, steadying himself by
resting a hand on the wall, holding his
seemingly aching head with the other.</p>

<p class='c004' >Keeping the table between them, and braced
against the ruse of a push against it to upset
him, Chick opened an end of the tracing and
verified his earlier guess.</p>

<p class='c004' >The tracing certainly looked like the rough
sketch for an airplane, with most of the
bracing and internal structure of the fuselage inked
in heavily, with the wide-spanning, thin, speedy
“slotted” wings sketched in more lightly, with
the tail assembly marked on, and with
innumerable sets of figures, in ink, underneath the
drawing.</p>

<p class='c004' >Swiftly he rolled it up and put it back into
his upper coat pocket, being sure that it could
neither shake nor be dropped out by folding it
over, jamming it down as far as he could, and
snapping a safety pin he saw in the drawer
across the pocket top. Doe watched him with a
woebegone look, as Chick judged it to be.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t know what you’re hiding, I don’t
that! Nor why you say I’m what I declare I
ain’t no such a thing—a traitor. But I’m going
on home, and doctor me up myself some.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Go on!” Chick braced for a rush, a
surprise.</p>

<p class='c004' >None came.</p>

<p class='c004' >Moodily, with head bent, Doc walked to the
doorway and out. Following him, Chick saw
him, picked out by the flashes, cross the planks
and disappear in the winding path.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Who was that?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Scott, coming around the side of the hovel
from the wharf, made his presence known,
asking the question sharply.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Doc Morgan,” Chick responded. “I found
him here. He had finished off a bottle, and he
had some tracings. I guess I forgot and left
them out on the designing room table when we
were talking about our plan for tonight.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Tracings! You don’t say? Let’s see them!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“In the morning!” said Chick, eagerly. “You
ought to go and help Don and Garry. Where’s
the Dart?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Over in the shelter of the grass, across the
water, there. What are the other two doing?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Quickly Chick told him where Don and Garry
had started for in the dory. They scanned the
water. The dory, invisible, hidden and held by
the wind among the weeds, told them no story
of its abandonment.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I guess they’re at the crack-up,” surmised
Scott. “Light two red flare signals, Chick. Get
those two back here. If I don’t get back to the
Dart she’ll never get above the storm in time.
The same for the Dragonfly. Get those boys
back here! If Don hurries he can get up aloft
in time.” Moving away he added, “After the
storm we’ll search.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick climbed to the struts over a rocking,
tossing wing of the tethered Dragonfly, secured
signals from the fuselage, and as he saw them
set and ignited Scott hurried off to get his own
lighter ship out of the danger area. Chick
refused to go along, preferring to risk Don’s less
experienced piloting. He would not desert his
chums.</p>

<p class='c004' >“By gracious!” he exclaimed to himself, “I
wonder if there are any more of those plans
in the drawer of that table? Doc might have
tried to hide them, stopped to celebrate, got too
‘tight’ to know what he was doing, and struck
his head when he staggered and fell. That
would account for the drawer being open so the
paper could blow out—I’ll go and have another
look!”</p>

<p class='c004' >He hastened back into the hovel, investigating
by the flicker of the lantern, wind-blown, but
staunchly holding its own.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Funny!” commented the youthful searcher.
“Why did he have only the least important
plan—the sketch? Maybe he has the others on
his person! I ought not to have let him go.
But I was so——”</p>

<p class='c004' >He paused, his words choked back into his
throat by a strange sound. Had something
struck the hovel? A blown limb, crashing
against the side, could have made that heavy,
but dull thud, hard to locate.</p>

<p class='c004' >To his horror, before he could locate the
source of the crash, a low, sepulchral voice
spoke!</p>

<p class='c004' >“Go!—Go!—I am the Thing That Never
Was—the Man Who Never Lived! Go—or I take
you with me—down—down—down-n-n-n!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick whirled to face about. In a corner,
behind him, half out of the floor, as it seemed,
was the shape of the Thing—terrifying, and yet
surprising. Green, dull and glistening, as if of
plastered seaweed or wet rubber was its head.
Heavy, glistening, ooze-covered was the
covering upon its partially disclosed torso. Green,
glistening, but dripping with slimy weed were
its waving, beckoning hands.</p>

<p class='c004' >Transfixed, rooted to his tracks, Chick
gasping, stared.</p>

<p class='c004' >Seen in the unearthly, fitful flashes of
lightning, the yellow lantern flicker and the dull
refracted red from the burning flares outside, the
apparition was horrifying enough.</p>

<p class='c004' >But Chick felt his muscles unchained as the
figure grew in height and advanced toward
him, its long, glistening, weed-spattered arms
outstretched. Like a streak of fleeing terror
Chick raced out of the door.</p>

<p class='c004' >There he paused, uncertain. It was safer in
the open than in the room: the signals and the
brighter light outside the cabin would enable
him to see better that Thing of Fear if it came
forth.</p>

<p class='c004' >Out it came, speaking no word. Terrified,
Chick ran. But for all its flapping encumbrance
of weird draperies, it was swift. It caught the
youth. Terror chilled his blood but he struggled.
Then his courage came welling to him. If those
hands could grip they must be human, and if
shins kicked in desperation could evoke human
growls of dismay, he faced no spectre, but a
flesh-and-blood creature.</p>

<p class='c004' >The man, in his horrid garments, was
searching with exploring fingers while he tried to hold
the squirming, kicking Chick who strove to be
free, to escape.</p>

<p class='c004' >There were shouts from the other side of the
hovel; suddenly Chick felt his inner pocket
ripped open, and the Thing—or man—was away
over the planking, running fleetly and with
sure steps. He knew that way!</p>

<p class='c004' >After him went Chick, into the twisting,
swamp-bound paths.</p>

<p class='c004' >Nor did he return until long after that!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c002'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />ABOVE THE STORMS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >While he fought the blasts of wind that tried
to twist the Dragonfly out of control, climbing
to get beyond their influence, Don tried to
decide on the best course.</p>

<p class='c004' >His ship was not equipped for navigation.
No compass or radio was provided to aid him
in such a difficult situation: otherwise it would
have been easy to rise beyond the storm levels,
to set his propeller toward some predetermined
objective where he could land safely and be
within reach of a hospital to care for the
injured mail ’plane pilot.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But I don’t know wind direction at different
levels,” he reflected, catching the ship as a gust
of fierce wind caught the tail and swung the ship
around, broadside to the wind.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t dare to run before the wind, because
it has grown so black and we’ve drifted so far
off by now that I might not get near the base,”
he added to himself.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, in the second seat, realized how
difficult the situation was for the youthful pilot.</p>

<p class='c004' >A run before the wind, he understood, might
take them out over the ocean before they knew
their danger: there it would be a question of
time only before the gas would be exhausted.</p>

<p class='c004' >Long Island, with the Atlantic to its East and
South-East, with the broad Sound along its
Western side and New York’s bays in the
South, was not the best place over which to fly
“blind.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The safest course, Garry thought, was to go
on climbing. Don, without being able to
exchange ideas, felt the same way.</p>

<p class='c004' >As the gusty wind got under the wings he
operated his controls to right the ship; when
the tail lifted, he compensated with the
elevators, always climbing when he dared. Rain
swept in stinging sheets across the wings and
into their faces, cold and stinging, making the
wings heavy, but Don gained slowly but surely
in his fight for altitude.</p>

<p class='c004' >Finally they emerged from the clouds, and
soon were able to rise beyond the worst of the
turbulent air.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ll go higher,” Don determined. “I want to
be safe from the upsweep of warm currents;
they upset the ship too much.”</p>

<p class='c004' >As he gained altitude, going close to the
“service ceiling” or safest and highest altitude at
which engine power was not dragged down too
much by the lightness of air, Don saw, with
dismay, that a worse complication confronted
him.</p>

<p class='c004' >The storms they had overcome were not the
only ones existing.</p>

<p class='c004' >After the humid, torrid day, storms were
visible to the North, to the East and to the West,
as far as his eyes could probe the lower strata
of air.</p>

<p class='c004' >Theirs would be a poor chance if he flew
toward the South: although only the
beginnings of turmoil lay in that direction, the sea
was waiting, and Don’s only choice seemed to
be to stay aloft as long as he could, hoping for
a lull between the periods of stress, through
which he could drop to a lower point, get his
location and perhaps make a landing.</p>

<p class='c004' >With unexpected fury an eddying uprush of
air took the Dragonfly in its fierce grip,
twisting and turning it, flinging the right wing high.</p>

<p class='c004' >Swiftly, and with more than his usual force,
Don threw the stick to a position that should
correct and right the ship.</p>

<p class='c004' >His heart turned cold, a sickish feeling came
into his stomach.</p>

<p class='c004' >Somewhere in the heart of the control cords
something parted.</p>

<p class='c004' >On wingtip, the nose began to fall.</p>

<p class='c004' >Instinctively, knowing that in that position
the rudder functioned as an elevator, Don
changed the position of the stick, using the
rudder bar to elevate the rudder, gunning on full
power to pull up the nose.</p>

<p class='c004' >In that position, however, while the nose came
up momentarily, saving them from a dive, Don
understood that they would very soon slip, on
wingtip, sidewise, down into the turbulence
below them.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, thanking his good fortune that he had
studied airplane design with Don, during their
work in the design and blue-print departments,
acted.</p>

<p class='c004' >He knew each rib, brace, strut and cable of
that ship, could picture their positions from the
multitude of drawings and of blue-prints he had
handled.</p>

<p class='c004' >With swift accuracy he kicked through the
flooring, light and very easy to demolish.</p>

<p class='c004' >Plunging his hands through the openings,
bent low, he probed with hurrying fingers for
the loose cables of the elevators.</p>

<p class='c004' >He found them.</p>

<p class='c004' >The tug he gave informed him that the break
of the cord lay between him and Don’s stick. He
could operate the elevators, but Don could not.</p>

<p class='c004' >With the cords tautened he waggled them,
shaking the ship.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don turned his head.</p>

<p class='c004' >He discerned Garry’s bent position, realized
what it meant.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, though not a trained pilot, knew the
operation of the controls and could co-operate
with Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >With a swift movement of the stick Don began
to right the ship as it started its sidewise slip.</p>

<p class='c004' >Immediately Garry, knowing that the
elevators would then function in their proper
capacity and that the rudder no longer could lift and
depress the nose, worked his cables.</p>

<p class='c004' >Before the ship could fall off again, Garry
drew the “flippers” upward. The engine, full
gun, helped their effort, the ship began to surge
forward, gaining flying speed in the proper
horizontal course.</p>

<p class='c004' >Watching the nose, his head lifted, his
position cramped, the broken end of the cable in
one hand and the slack of the other side held in
his other fist, Garry watched the ship’s
fore and-aft spirit level because his mission was to
hold the nose on a level.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, with the customary signal of his arm,
pointed straight ahead.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry agreed with his decision to maintain
a level course, flying into the wind.</p>

<p class='c004' >The gas gauge showed that they had fuel to
last several hours. From the other instruments
it was evident that oil feed and pressure, and
other necessary functions, were operating
correctly.</p>

<p class='c004' >If they could fly beyond the worst of the
storm area, in the time their fuel reserve gave
them, they might, by dint of careful cooperation,
get down without serious disaster. Don looked
back, pointed ahead.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry nodded.</p>

<p class='c004' >Thus they flew on. Don knew that Garry, bent
almost double, stretching his neck upward, was
in a straining, difficult posture.</p>

<p class='c004' >It would be a question of his muscular ability
to hold himself against the torture that must
come with the unnatural pose: aching muscles
could in time compel him to relax, perhaps to
let go of the cable.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Good old Garry!” whispered Don to himself.
“If it’s in human power to last, he will be the
one to stick it out!”</p>

<p class='c004' >It was torture, as Garry came to know before
they ended that flight.</p>

<p class='c004' >Ignorant of the drift of the wind, unaware
of the real course, only able to guess at the
flight direction by the position of the rising
moon, Don surmised that they were flying in a
somewhat Northerly course.</p>

<p class='c004' >Ahead he saw, with thankful eyes, an edge of
a cloud dispersing its fury in rain. There the
flashes of celestial fire diminished in intensity.</p>

<p class='c004' >Finally, with hearts that thanked a power
greater than storm force, by dint of careful
manipulation of signals and of controls, they
made a landing in a field, amid quiet,
storm-washed hills!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c002'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />THE HAUNTED SWAMP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Drenched by rain, almost blinded by the
incessant lightning, Chick drew up on the narrow
footway among the grasses that the wind swept
against his face.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’m lost!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c004' >All around him, as far as his sight could reach
in the flashes, tall, waving, unbroken marsh
grass showed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Somewhere I took a wrong path,” Chick told
himself.</p>

<p class='c004' >Shivering, he stood, fumbling at the buttons
of his coat.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That man who tried to make me think he
was a spook, calling himself ‘the Thing that
never was, and the Man who Never Lived,’” he
said bitterly, “tore my coat pocket.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He put a hand inside his garment to estimate
the damage.</p>

<p class='c004' >A great feeling of elation crowded out his
momentary shudder of fear on realizing his
dreadful situation.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He didn’t get—the tracing!” cried Chick to
the storm-swept grass.</p>

<p class='c004' >He laughed in exultant delight.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That Doc!” he exclaimed. “He was in such
a hurry that instead of getting the tracing I
had folded down on itself, he grabbed out the
envelope of stamps I had in that pocket!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Crowded into a long manila envelope Chick
always kept a loose lot of assorted postage
stamps, ready to “trade” for new varieties to
add to a collection he was making.</p>

<p class='c004' >In his haste the unknown—but easily
guessed—adversary had caught hold of the fat
envelope, crushed down as Chick had pinned in
the other paper. Released, it had popped up.
That had been his trophy. Chick danced and
shouted triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He’s welcome to all those Bavarian and
Venezuelan duplicate stamps!” cried Chick,
making sure that the precious tracing was
secure from any chance rip of the pocket allowing
it to drop out, “and if he can make anything
by selling a hundred cancelled American
two-cent stamps, he will do better than I ever did!”
He felt elated; but the distressing situation
he was in came back to him and his face sobered
in the glaring light of the tempest.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I see the boathouse,” he told himself. “I
guess I’d better go back there, and not try to
get out of here in this storm.”</p>

<p class='c004' >By guiding himself in the revealing light
from the skies, he managed to get back to the
right path, pushing through clutching clumps of
the soggy, clinging grass that had hidden the
way out but did not wholly conceal the way
back. He had heard the Dragonfly, knew it had
gone up.</p>

<p class='c004' >Once more sheltered he shivered in his wet
clothing, but made the best of a bad condition
by righting an old, rickety chair and turning
up the lantern wick till it gave a better light.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Now,” he remarked to himself, “let’s
see—Doc was here, and for all his denials I am sure
he had taken the tracing—maybe others! I
remember that I was sorting out the drawings of
the new, all-metal ship, to make blue-prints in
the morning. Scott came in and I guess I was
so excited at the prospect of guarding the
airlanes that I left those drawings on the big
table.”</p>

<p class='c004' >There it would be easy for Doc, sweeping up,
to find them, to abstract any—or many.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But he might have told the truth about not
‘celebrating,’” he said, thoughtfully. “He never
has any money to buy big bottles of alcohol. If
he had been paid by anybody for the new
designs, he wouldn’t have had the one I
discovered. He must have been waiting for somebody
else to come.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He recalled the course of events that had
transpired. Had the “other man” come? Was
it he who had played ghost? Chick wondered,
clutching his torn, soggy coat as tightly about
him as possible. Not that it warmed him much;
but the act was involuntary as his mind focused
on the weird apparition he had seen.</p>

<p class='c004' >Instinctively his eyes went to that dark,
gloom-crowded corner of the hovel.</p>

<p class='c004' >In a lull of the storm he seemed to hear
something gurgling, slapping, like water against
pilings. It was too clear to come from the
channels beyond the closed door.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I wonder—if there was a trap door—” he
meditated.</p>

<p class='c004' >Summoning his courage he walked over to the
corner. To his surprise he discovered, in the
gloom that had concealed it, an unclosed flap
of the flooring, leaning back against the wall.
In the dull light from the lantern it had not been
noticed, against the similarly dark wall boards.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s a trap door to steps so the boatman can
get down to the dories he keeps tied under the
place,” Chick decided.</p>

<p class='c004' >He did not care to explore the mysterious
depths below, however.</p>

<p class='c004' >Closing the square of flooring on the fury of
the water beneath, he returned to his chair.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I know about the Man who Never Lived,
now,” he told himself. “It was Doc Morgan.
He saw I had the tracing. He told me all that
made-up stuff, and then went out. He came
back, over the dories, maybe, under the place,
and came up the ladder, in oilskins and rubber
cap and gloves. Pouff! I guess that’s all there
was to the ghost.”</p>

<p class='c004' >That made him wonder if, in some way, they
might find an equally sensible explanation for
the spectre that had appeared and vanished so
mysteriously in the clouds.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But Don flew right into that cloud!” Chick
objected to his own hopeful theory. “There
wasn’t a thing there.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He sat, shivering with the chill of his wet
garb, wondering how long the successively
approaching storms would continue.</p>

<p class='c004' >Long hours seemed to pass. Chick got up,
exercised, flailed his arms and did gymnastic
exercises to promote circulation. Nevertheless,
time dragged slowly.</p>

<p class='c004' >The intensity of the storm lessened:
lightning came more fitfully, rain ceased, thunder
grumbled and ceased to crash, dying away in the
South. Chick went to the door, looking out.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There are stars,” he observed the bright
sparks showing through the drifting,
scattering shreds of the tempest, “maybe I ought to
try to get home. They’ll be worried about me.
I wonder where Don and Garry landed and if
they got down all right.”</p>

<p class='c004' >They had, but far up the Hudson.</p>

<p class='c004' >Swamp life began to make itself heard—and
felt.</p>

<p class='c004' >Fish leaped, hungry for insects. Frogs
began to sing their uncanny songs. Mosquitos,
made ferocious by the cooling air, attacked
Chick in swarms. He retired to the house,
closing the door, killing as many of the pests as he
could.</p>

<p class='c004' >The bites decided him against a foray into
the marsh paths. He had read of several cases
of people, lost in marshy country, who had been
dangerously bitten and infected by the swarms
of nocturnal pests, swamp mosquitos.</p>

<p class='c004' >He sat down again, drawing out and
spreading the map before him on his table.</p>

<p class='c004' >Damp, softened, the paper was very hard to
handle. He wondered, as he studied it, why
Doc had chosen that special one, if it was all he
had taken.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It doesn’t show much of the real
construction detail,” he mused. “If I’d wanted to sell
plans, I’d have taken the detail drawings—the
new pontoon design, the special tail
construction plans, the details of the way the plates
would fit together for strength and lightness.
Oh, well, maybe Doc took what first came to
hand and was looking it over—with his bottle to
help him think it was valuable!”</p>

<p class='c004' >He looked up, startled.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Was that a step?” he asked himself,
straining his ears.</p>

<p class='c004' >With instinctive caution he slipped the curled
paper back into his coat, buttoning its loose
buttons across his chest.</p>

<p class='c004' >A low, hollow thumping came to his tense
ears.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What’s that?” he wondered. “Where is it
coming from?”</p>

<p class='c004' >He kept mouse-still, listening.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s—at the door!”</p>

<p class='c004' >His heart was in his throat.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Has Doc come back?” he watched the door.
Something—or someone—was fumbling at the
latch, striking knuckles against the wood.</p>

<p class='c004' >In spite of his earlier assurance that the
supposed spook had been only a man made
horrible by light and queer clothing, Chick felt a
chill strike to his marrow.</p>

<p class='c004' >The latch clicked.</p>

<p class='c004' >Slowly the door began to open.</p>

<p class='c004' >With wide—staring eyes—Chick fixed his
gaze on the widening crack.</p>

<p class='c004' >He jumped. With a slam the door came
inward, banging against the inner boards.</p>

<p class='c004' >In the dark square—there was nothing visible.</p>

<p class='c004' >He summoned his wit and by sheer force of
will made himself run to the door. He looked
out. The path, the planking, the platform on
which the house stood, were devoid of sign of
human life.</p>

<p class='c004' >He ran back, closing the door. He dragged
the table against it, bracing it against another
strange attack. He stood over the trap door to
prevent its uncanny opening without warning.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then the lantern flame flared up,
guttered—went out!</p>

<p class='c004' >A sound, half squeal, half groan, assailed
Chick’s ears as he cowered in the dark hovel. He
realized at once what it was.</p>

<p class='c004' >Pushing the table across the floor, the door
was being opened.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c002'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />ONE MYSTERY—OR TWO?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Slowly the table grated back across the floor
of the hut.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then, to Chick’s intense relief, a cheerful
voice hailed him.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Ahoy, the boathouse! Who’s in there?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s—Chick—Chickering——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Gosh-a-mighty!” Chick sensed a familiar
ring in the exclamation. “In the name of
all-possessed! What are you doing in my
boathouse?”</p>

<p class='c004' >The door thrust the table back, a dark form
showed in the rays of the moon that peered from
the edge of scattering clouds, and Chick, with a
great sense of relief, recognized that his newest
companion was Toby Tew, who operated a small
motion picture “palace” in Winter and eked out
a meager living by renting dories to crabbing
parties in the Summer.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Show a light!” he ordered Chick. “What
made you blow out the lantern?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I didn’t. It went out.” Chick clutched the
arm of the big man in his heavy oilskins as he
thrilled to the touch of human contact. “Mr.
Tew, did you see anything—hear anything?”</p>

<p class='c004' >The other laughed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Sort of spooky, hey? No. I guess I was
part of the ghost, and your excitement furnished
the balance. I saw a light when I started down
channel to see to my dories after the blow. ‘A
light!’ thinks I, ‘that’s a how-dy-do!’ So I
pushed the door open, and got out of range, case
it was some bootlegger run in out o’ the blow.
I heard you coming out so I dodged across and
got behind a spile. Thinks I, ‘I don’t want any
bootlegger to bore me. If he wants to shelter
in my boathouse, let him,’ thinks I, ‘but I won’t
try collecting rent—not in the kind of lead the
bootleggers uses to pay their taxes!’”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’m glad it was you,” Chick said, and on
Toby’s earnest question as to his reason for
being there, Chick spoke in fullest confidence.</p>

<p class='c004' >He knew Toby Tew, as did all the youths of
Port Washington and its vicinity, knew him for
a kindly, good-humored, open-handed man. No
parent was ever visited because prankish youths
“borrowed” dories and returned them with am
oar missing. No party of boys lacking funds
had to forego crabbing expeditions as long as
Toby had spare dories not in demand for pay.
Any Winter evening there were plenty of spare
seats at the picture theatre for young men who
wanted amusement but were out of pocket
money—and they always paid when they could!</p>

<p class='c004' >“Um! Gosh-a-mighty!” exclaimed the
boatman-picture exhibitor, when Chick had related
the suggestions of Scott, the ensuing flight, the
coming of the mail ’plane, the spectre visitation
and its vanishment, and the events that had
followed, “in the name of all—possessed! You
don’t say! Doc!—why, Doc never stole in his
life!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Somebody had to bring those designs here,”
Chick maintained. “Doc was here when I came,”
he gestured toward the bottle and the upset
condition of the hut, revealed by the refilled
lantern; Toby, who had made a foray on his
reserve can of kerosine for the lantern, set the
utensil in its place.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Doc never done that! Gosh-a-mighty! I’ve
known that fellow for a lifetime, almost! In the
name of all-possessed, though, who would of
come up through my trap door with oilskins
and green rubber gloves and a bathing cap on?
And what for? And Doc did say he saw the
same——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s easy to say you ‘saw’ something if you
mean to ‘be it,’” Chick explained. But Toby
shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He wouldn’t go that far to try to throw a
scare into you,” he remonstrated. “And Doe
seldom uses alcohol. More’n that, there’s some
mighty funny goings-on around this marsh, of
late—mighty funny.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I know it!” Chick agreed. “That spooky
airplane and then the two ghosts crashing
together—Scott said some old-timer around the
marsh had seen it and remembered about a
crack-up years ago and thinks it’s the ghost of
the pilot who caused the smash, unable to rest,
haunting the place; and—from what we
saw—I begin to wonder.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Not me. Gosh-a-mighty, son, there’s a whole
heap of easier ways to account for it than that.
Supposing the airport beacon was lit,
say—flashing around. Supposing your airplane was
to fly across that ray just when it came onto a
cloud. How about the shadow?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don showed how that could be, when he
came in,” Chick agreed, “but that won’t account
for the crash of two airplanes.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But if Scott had took up the Dart—in the
name of all-possessed!” Sitting in the chair the
boatman slapped his knee. “That’s what it was.
The Dart flew one way. You was going another.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He paused to emphasize his next words.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The two shadows showed, coming together!——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That won’t explain it,” Chick interrupted.
“The airplanes were of the old style—like the
war Jennies, or old-style biplanes.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“In that queer light, and with your minds
keyed up to expect something——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But how would it help if that did explain
the spook tonight? We weren’t flying around
the other times!” Chick was unconvinced.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s so!” Toby rubbed his chin. “Besides,
how does that work in with this about the
mysterious airplane design being found here. Let’s
have a look, what do you say?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick uncurled the soggy paper, carefully, on
the table.</p>

<p class='c004' >“In the name of all-possessed! Nobody’d steal
that! It don’t mean a thing, does it?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well—only the general body design and
strut placement. And I don’t see why they
sketched in wings and control surfaces, on a
structural skeleton.” Chick was puzzled.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Hum! You know more about that than I
would. Son, it’s a mystery!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Is it one mystery—or two?” Very soberly
Chick looked up. “Do you see how taking this
tracing fits in with the spectre in the sky?”</p>

<p class='c004' >As Toby shook his head and bent again over
the tracery, Chick went on, in the yellow
lantern light.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We thought the haunting might be by some
enemy of Don’s uncle, to ruin the airport
business,” he argued. “If that is so, then this about
the tracing is a different mystery.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Gosh-a-mighty! You’re smart for your age!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Toby looked up admiringly. “Now, then, what
reason would you say made anybody want to
take this—” He put a stubby finger on the
tracing, looking up with a curious intensity in
his gaze that surprised and startled Chick a
little.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I—I guess I give that up.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I guess you’ll have to! Son—look at this
thing. Hold it up to the light!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Astonished, Chick did so.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Notice anything odd about it?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Some of the ink has run——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s part of it, son. The part that has
run is——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Wait!” cried Chick, thrilling with a
discovery. “The wings and the struts, and some of
the ‘empennage’—the tail assembly—is done in
India waterproof ink!——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Not alone that.” Toby became very serious.
“That’s no design of an airplane, my lad.
That’s—but, here! Gosh-a-mighty! I’m forgetting
that you’re sopping wet and cold, and the folks
at home will be having a search party out after
you. Let’s get my dory and I’ll row you down
to the ‘base.’” He caught up the lantern as
Chick picked up the tracing.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Wait!” begged Chick. “If it isn’t an
airplane—what is it?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Lantern in hand, Toby turned to him.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s the hull of an old-time sailing brig!”
he declared.</p>

<p class='c004' >And with that he added a third mystery—or
didn’t he?</p>

</div>

<p class='c003' >Landing flares dropped by Garry were still
burning as Don cut the ignition of the
Dragonfly. From a house adjoining the field they were
in, a farmer came running to the airplane.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Where are we?” Don called eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Is there a place near where they can take
care of this pilot?” cried Garry. “He’s hurt—we
don’t know how badly.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The farmer came closer.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Hurt, eh!” He attended to the more
important question first. “I don’t know of any place
for miles where you could take him. But I can
telephone old Ti-O-Ga. He’s an Indian. Lives
a few miles back from the Hudson. Everybody
knows him. He’s a kind of ‘medicine man’ and
he’s a wonder with broken bones.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He turned, informing Don, over his shoulder,
that the field was a few miles beyond Catskill,
a town in the Hudson River valley.</p>

<p class='c004' >The pilot, his senses recovered, but suffering,
spoke up. “Old Ti-O-Ga? Why, yes. Get him. I’ve
heard of him.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c005'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >“Go with the gentleman, Garry,” Don
suggested. “When he has done his telephoning he
may let you get the airport and tell Uncle Bruce
what has happened to us.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry went away while Don remained with
the pilot, keeping his flares going for light and
on the chance that a passing automobile on the
adjacent road might stop and go for a
physician. Don was not deeply impressed by the offer
of Indian aid.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry returned very quickly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I got the airport,” he told his chum. “They
were worried about us, and of course your uncle
feels badly because we still have the mail.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’m going to signal a passing car,” Don said.
“If I can get the driver to take me to some place
where I can get fuel, I’ll fly back.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ll stay with the pilot,” Garry volunteered.
Don had no trouble in inducing a motorist to
give him a “lift” to a garage at some distance.
Ti-O-Ga came in a car while Don was gone.
Old, but straight and sturdy, the Indian
surprised Garry: he arrived in a Ford, wore
American clothes and, if reticent, spoke to the point.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Drink!” he ordered the pilot, offering a small
cup of liquid taken from the car. The pilot,
putting the liquid down his throat, sat in his
cockpit quietly for a moment.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Say!” he exclaimed, “that’s great stuff, Big
Chief!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You feel like walk?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Helped out, with some muttered exclamations
as his limp arm was put to a strain, the man
admitted that he felt much stronger.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I take you to house. Strip! Find what is
wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The pilot, assisted by the farmer and by
Garry, made slow but steady progress to the
farmhouse.</p>

<p class='c004' >There, while he waited, the Indian gave Garry
a steady, and very curious observation.</p>

<p class='c004' >The youth began to feel uncomfortable. He
had a feeling as though those bleak, steady eyes
were boring through him. He shifted uneasily.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I be done soon,” Ti-O-Ga remarked, rising
at the call of “ready” and moving toward the
next room where the pilot had been prepared for
an examination, “then you tell me all troubles.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“How did you know I had troubles?” Garry
was amazed. “I have—but how did you know
that?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I be back.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry sat quietly in the small, cozy living
room, waiting.</p>

<p class='c004' >In a surprisingly short time the Indian
returned with the farmer.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Chief Ti,” the farm owner remarked to
Garry, “Chief Ti is a wonder. He’s got the
man’s arm set—not a bad fracture, he says. No
internal injuries, and what he gave that chap to
take will put him on his feet in short order.
Ti’s a wizard at doctoring.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“He said I had troubles,” Garry exclaimed.
“How did he know?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don’t ask me,” the farmer retorted, smiling.
“Old Ti is a queer one and he can read people
the way you’d read a book. Can’t explain how
he does it; but I can see he’s taken a liking to
you—and just take my advice, buddy, and let
him do what he wants, answer all his questions,
and don’t argue about his ways. He’s Indian—but
they say he is the closest thing to a real
magician this side of the world. He showed me
some things, once, like the Hindu fakirs
do—creepy, but interesting.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The Indian beckoned to Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You come,” he said, “I give you charm.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“A charm!” Garry repeated. “What for?—”
Then, recalling the advice just given him, he
rose and followed the tall, dark figure. “I thank
you, I mean to say—but I don’t see how you
know——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I know.”</p>

<p class='c004' >That was the end of the conversation. Garry,
at the other’s sign, climbed into the old Ford
beside the driving seat which Ti occupied.</p>

<p class='c004' >Rapidly, skilfully, he was driven into the back
country.</p>

<p class='c004' >The ride was very short, it seamed. Good
speed and clever handling of the wheel on a
road free from traffic helped.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well,” Garry mused, “this is a queer
business. First we try to guard the airlanes and
see a spook crash in the sky; then we get lost
and have to set down at the very best
place—from the way that pilot was handled. Now I’m
bound for some Indian tepee, I guess—to get
a charm. For what? How does he know
anything, and what does old Ti know?”</p>

<p class='c004' >He soon discovered.</p>

<p class='c004' >“This is my house.” The car stopped in front
of a small, but neat frame building, a cottage
whose windows gave out cheerful light. Garry,
accustomed to stories of frontier Indians, gazed
in astonishment as he was ushered into a neat,
well-furnished living room with a telephone in
one corner. At a wave of the slim, gnarled hand
he sat down, quiet and mystified. From a rear
room a woman, not altogether Indian, and very
pretty in a bold, strong-featured way, brought
in cold meat, bread and cocoa which she put on
a handy table. Invited to eat, Garry realized
how ravenous he was and attacked the food with
good will.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You like rest?” the Indian asked when the
girl, probably a daughter, removed the dishes
and cups.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’d rather go back and help my chum.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“He not back yet. Rest! You sleep, huh?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry shook his head; but a drowsiness
seemed to be creeping over him; his muscles felt
heavy and inert; he struggled with the
increasing desire to sleep, feeling some uneasiness as
the steady eyes held without blinking,
watching him intently.</p>

<p class='c004' >He relaxed, and began to dream an uneasy,
garbled mass of disconnected flashes. He felt
as though he drifted above a dark, dismal
swamp and he saw again that spectral ship
flying toward him. The dream altered. He seemed
to be watching Chick, in some dim light,
examining a scroll or roll of paper-thin, almost
transparent.</p>

<p class='c004' >Soon he awoke.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I didn’t mean to drop off—excuse me,” he
mumbled.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then his faculties asserted themselves. He
sat up, alertly. The Indian!—had he put
something in the cocoa? Had he used the same
methods Garry had seen in stage
demonstrations, to get a person into a helpless state in
which they did as they were told and answered
questions in a dreamy, far-away fashion?</p>

<p class='c004' >He looked around.</p>

<p class='c004' >Through an open door he saw the tall,
red-skinned man putting some objects into a small,
dark-looking little pouch. The strings of its
mouth he drew together as he returned to nod
pleasantly at Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Feel all good?” he asked. Garry nodded.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I——”</p>

<p class='c004' >The man did not allow him to go on.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You troubled by ghost in the sky,” he said.
“You not think right answer about why! You
take this.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He held out the small pouch, several inches
long, a little more in depth, apparently filled
with some unrevealed contents, its string of
rawhide tightly knotted to hold the mouth
puckered, and a small, very odd wax seal in red,
showing a swastika-cross, covering the top.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Take,” he repeated. Garry held out his hand,
hesitatingly, lost in wonder that the man knew
about the spectral visitations that mystified the
Airlane Guard. “Hear, now. Put over head.”
He gestured. Garry, widening the strings,
slipped the pouch over his head. “Keep inside
coat. Go home. Put in box for seven day! Not
touch! Then—open!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why?” demanded Garry, surprised but
suspicious.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why! That is good charm, boy! You worry
about ghost wings.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He made a clutching motion of fingers and
thumb, as though wielding a pair of scissors.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You see ghost wings! I make charm to clip
ghost wing!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, puzzled, stared; but the man tapped
on the table, a slim, dark youth entered. Ti-O-Ga
said “Goodbye” and before he could muster any
comment, Garry was ushered to the car, the
young Indian took the wheel and, fingering his
pouch, tucked inside his clothes, Garry rode
away.</p>

<p class='c004' >“A charm,” he muttered, “a charm—to clip
ghost wings! Hope it works!”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c004' ><a href='#r1'>1</a>.
While the name is necessarily changed, there lives,
in the Hudson River valley an aged Indian “medicine man”
whose herbal remedies and other curative methods are famous
over a wide area: his “magic” is less widely known, but is
in line with the possession of certain secrets of Nature
and of mental ability of a high order and amazed the youth
by his businesslike and plainly successful methods.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c002'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />THE CHARM SEEMS TO WORK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >When Don and Garry, leaving the pilot to
mend his bones and recuperate in the
farmhouse, brought the mail down, they found Chick
fairly bursting with his adventures.</p>

<p class='c004' >His story had other interested listeners
besides the youthful pilot and Garry. Doc Morgan
sat beside Don, Toby Tew occupied a chair by
the designing room table, and the airport owner,
Bruce McLeod, shared a wall bench with the
control room operator, a close-mouthed,
black-eyed man who was none too well-liked by the
personnel of the new venture.</p>

<p class='c004' >Everyone gave close attention while Chick
related his adventures.</p>

<p class='c004' >“In the name of all-possessed!” exclaimed
Toby, “if that was put in a movie, I’d be
able to pack the Palace when I showed it.
I didn’t hear all that, last night, Chick-o!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I was too excited to remember all the
details,” Chick responded. He turned to Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You and Don got lost, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don nodded, smiling.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Garry had all the adventures,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004' >Pressed for his story, Garry told about the
Indian, his strange insight into the youth’s
mind, what he did, and what he gave.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I claim you ought to put that in your movie,
I do,” Doc told Toby. “I know old Ti well. He
learned me, he did, all I know about herb
doctoring.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I went up there, not long since,” Toby stated.
“Wanted to hire him to make a ‘personal
appearance’ on the stage of the Palace with a
film that was made up Catskill way, with him
in it. Couldn’t make any deal with him, though.
But—Gosh-a-mighty! Think of him
mesmerizing Garry! In the name of all-thunderation!
That’s queer!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It isn’t any more queer than the chart—the
tracing you say is a drawing of an old-time
brigantine,” declared Don. “Let’s see that,
now.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick went to the filing cabinets devoted to
storage of accepted design tracings, hunted
through a folder, kept under lock and key, and
put the tracing on the table.</p>

<p class='c004' >An exclamation caused them all to turn.</p>

<p class='c004' >The control room operator was staring,
astonished and pleased: he leaped to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004' >“So that’s what you found!” he exclaimed,
moving quickly forward. “Brigantine-nothing!
That’s a sketch I—er—mislaid. I guess it got
mixed up with the regular stuff and was brought
in here—but how did it get to the swamps?”
Chick watched him with narrowed eyes.</p>

<p class='c004' >“A sketch,” Chick thought. “Oh, yes! Part
of it in faded ink and part of it in India
waterproof ink, the sort they use here!”</p>

<p class='c004' >He did not voice his suspicion. It came to
his mind that the control room man would bear
watching. Through him, Chick decided, they
might get some clue to the mysteries they had
encountered.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Before I touch it,” the man continued, “Mr.
McLeod, just take a look at the lower,
left-hand corner and see if my initials are put in
the angle of what is meant to be the bow of a
new-shaped fuselage.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes,” admitted the airport manager, with
a glance at the sketch. “J. V.—John Vance.
Take it, and let’s get out of here so the boys
can go to work. They’ll be paid by the aircraft
company, and it’s a good thing. They’ll be
paid! If any more trouble comes to our
airport, I guess Doc, and Scott, won’t draw any
pay checks.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Scott, coming in from the adjoining office,
laughed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ll ‘haunt you’ if I don’t!” he chuckled.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I wish we could solve the mysteries!” Garry
spoke earnestly: he felt sorry for the harassed
man who had put all his available capital into
the new airport, who had enlisted his friends’
savings in the swamp draining and expansion
project. The engineers, Garry knew, had been
“called off” and their activity in the marsh had
been stopped. It was of no use to add further
expense, increase available runways or hangars.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Solve the mystery of how I am going to meet
unpaid bills,” growled Bruce McLeod. “You’ll
please me enough if you do that!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Uncle,” Don jumped from his seat on the
table edge, “it was partly my fault that the mail
was held back all night-—”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh—no!” The older man shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It was, in a way!” Don insisted. “I should
have flown straight here and tried to beat the
storm, but I prevented the mail from coming in
by going above the storm and getting lost.
Won’t the steamship company give us another
trial?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t know. Haven’t bothered them.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why not try again?” Garry suggested. “All
pioneer work has to fail before it succeeds. They
ought to let you have another chance.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I suppose they would.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“See!” urged Don, “Scott could meet the ship.
He’d never dive for any ghost,” with a grin.
“He likes spooks!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’d like to bring in the ocean mail, too,”
Scott agreed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You’re elected!” Chick exulted. “It’s as good
as done. And with, the chart tracing identified
and claimed, it doesn’t make any difference how
it got into the old boathouse. Maybe I ought
to apologize to Doc for accusing him. I do! I
jumped to the notion he had taken it but he is
proved innocent because he wasn’t anywhere
near the control room—and we don’t know but
what the paper blew out a window and was
picked up by some visitor to the airport who
went on a crabbing trip and put the paper down
there by chance.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick felt that his explanation was rather
lame, but he made it in an attempt to show Doc
Morgan that he was no longer suspected of
being a traitor to his employers.</p>

<p class='c004' >For some strange reason it began to seem as
though the Indian’s mysterious pouch had some
virtue.</p>

<p class='c004' >At any rate, everything became quiet around
the airport.</p>

<p class='c004' >The seventh day arrived, and on its night the
chums watched the dark skies without reward.</p>

<p class='c004' >No apparition of an airplane appeared: no
pair of phantom ships materialized to enact
their collision and disappear.</p>

<p class='c004' >With the spectre of the skies inactive, the
rest of the mysteries also dropped into the
background of attention. Don was busy with his
work on the tracings for the all-metal airplane
which he was helping Scott to create.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry studied airplane design while he
prepared and photographed the multitudes of
blue-prints that had to be made for each new model
the aircraft corporation planned to try out.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick was kept fully occupied: tabulating,
filing and procuring for the builders such
blue-prints as they required, engaged his whole time.</p>

<p class='c004' >His amateurish effort to watch the control
room man had brought no fruit: after a day or
two Chick had given up that activity.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well,” remarked Don, as the trio stood on
the control tower balcony, about to leave after a
futile vigil, with no developments to report, “the
seventh night has come, Friday, the thirteenth
is almost past—and we can——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Your uncle wants to see you—right away!”
Doc Morgan interrupted.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Scott was to fly out to meet the <i>Caledonia</i>—to
pick up the mail and fly it in! Scott’s been
hurt by a prop that flew off its hub——”</p>

<p class='c004' >Three excited faces turned to the stairway.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He might want you to fly the mail!” cried
Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I hope he does!” Garry told Don. “What a
chance!” Don kept his hope unvoiced. But he
did hope!</p>

<p class='c004' >Unaware that their excitement made them
join Don to answer a summons not meant for
them, Chick and Garry were at Don’s heels
when he entered his uncle’s private office.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What a break!” the harassed airport
executive grumbled. “I took your suggestion, as you
know, Don. The <i>Caledonia</i> is bringing special
mail pouches from Liverpool. Scott was
warming up the Dart. Just when we need the ship
and the pilot most—the propeller hub loosened,
the casting broke or it wanted oil and burned
out. Whatever happened, Scott’s out of the
running, and so is the Dart. I sent for you——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Mr. McLeod!” Chick broke in, forgetting
manners in his excitement, “we went over the
Dragonfly today! She’s in apple pie order.
Can’t Don take her aloft? Can’t he fly the mail?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Can you?” The man turned to his nephew.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I can—but how does Scott pick up the mail?”
The maneuver was explained to him.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Can’t Garry and Chick go along?” begged
Don, generously including his comrades. “They
could help a lot, and maybe make up by
helping me for the slower speed of the Dragonfly.”</p>

<p class='c004' >It was arranged.</p>

<p class='c004' >Eager, excited, with a possible contract for
mail flying at stake, three earnest airlane
enthusiasts got their flying togs and necessary
articles from the disabled Dart, signal lights to
identity the new ship, warmed up the Dragonfly,
and were ready to take off.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ll radio the <i>Caledonia</i> about the change,”
Mr. McLeod said. “Now—boys—do your best—and
be—careful!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh, we will!” Chick waved a hand from the
cockpit. “Anyhow—we’ve got to come through.
We carry a charm to clip ghost wings, you
know!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick always boasted a trifle too early!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />DON FLIES THE MAIL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Taking off into the July south-wind, Don
waited only long enough to observe the regulation
compelling an airplane to be well beyond
the airport limits before turning. Then he
began a turning climb to nose into the East,
crossing Long Island.</p>

<p class='c004' >Although their course did not take them near
the swamps which had been so closely
connected with their mystery—or mysteries!—Don
glanced in that direction.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, behind him, busy adjusting the tube
of the student’s communication helmet by which
he could talk to Don, did not see what the pilot
noted. Don shook the ship gently. Garry looked
up.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, behind them, getting a life belt
inflated from an air bottle, because this would be
a part of the mail flight requiring him to run
a slight risk of immersion in the sea, looked up
at the same time.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don’s hand, waved toward the swamps at the
left wingtip, as they came around, saw a curious
object over the swamps.</p>

<p class='c004' >They were too far away to note it with much
certainty; but Garry was sure that the queer,
ungainly thing rising steadily into the air was
one of the aircraft whose horizontal blades,
above the fuselage, enabled it to take off and
rise without first attaining the flying speed
required by an ordinary airplane. Its huge
propeller blades acted both as power and support
surfaces.</p>

<p class='c004' >“An auto-gyro,” Garry said into the helmet
communication tube.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What did you tell him?” Chick bent far
forward to shout to Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Said it was an auto-gyro!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No!” Chick had sharp eyes. “It isn’t the
modern kind, anyhow. It’s what they call a
‘helicopter,’ Garry.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry looked a second time, carefully.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Chick’s right,” he murmured to Don. “He
says it’s a helicopter—it has the lifting blades
that let it rise straight upward and then it has
a ‘tractor’ propeller forward that sends it
through the air horizontally. It can go higher
by giving the horizontal blades more speed, stay
almost stationary by adjusting speed, or settle
lower by slowing the blades. The tractor prop
gives it forward speed. Chick’s right.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don nodded. That had been the reason he
shook his head, to correct Garry’s terminology,
because all the more modern auto-gyros he had
seen employed an adjustable-angle horizontal
set of blades for both upward and forward
speed, and had refined the tractor propeller at
the nose.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But what is a helicopter doing over the
swamp?” he wondered, “and where did it come
from?”</p>

<p class='c004' >With a meeting arranged between the
amphibian Dragonfly and the big trans-Atlantic liner,
there was no time to investigate.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Does that helicopter have anything to do
with the mystery?” Garry spoke through the
Gossport tube.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don could not give an answer.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It might,” Garry continued. “Only I don’t
see just how. The spook ships we saw come
together in the sky were old-fashioned biplanes.
They weren’t real, either, because you flew right
into the cloud, Don.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The pilot nodded. Their speed rapidly took
them Eastward, and away from the swamp;
but as he set his course, bearing slightly North,
crossing one of the Island’s flying fields at a
good altitude and with Barren Island’s new
Bennett field back of the right wing’s trailing
edge, he puzzled his brain a great deal about
that strange ship rising from the swamps. Why
was it there at all? Had it been forced to settle
there? Or—did someone keep it there? If so,
he thought, for what purpose?</p>

<p class='c004' >“With the airport so handy, nobody would
store a helicopter anywhere in a mucky swamp,”
he decided. “It must have been a compulsory
landing.”</p>

<p class='c004' >With the lights of Coney Island, far to the
right, and of Long Beach, and the Rockaways
showing their Summer activities more nearly
under the trucks, Don nosed out over the sea.</p>

<p class='c004' >There he opened the throttle almost full-gun.</p>

<p class='c004' >They must meet the liner as far out as
possible. The fuel supply had been calculated to
take them a hundred and thirty miles out and
back with the essential safety reserve; Don had
a notion to stretch that distance a trifle, because
every mile the airplane saved the ship before
the return would mean that much more rapidity
in bringing in the mail.</p>

<p class='c004' >Many ships came up over the horizon, were
passed, and receded behind the tail.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick’s sharp eyes first discerned the special
signal carried for the occasion by the liner they
sought to meet.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Good work,” Garry commended as Chick
poked him three times and indicated the tiny
trio of white lights set above a blue one on the
masthead of the approaching boat, just coming
up, it seemed, over the horizon line.</p>

<p class='c004' >He gave Don the position. The youthful pilot
shifted rudder and altered the course somewhat,
gunning up to full speed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We will meet her ten miles further out then
we expected to,” he murmured, pleased. That
would mean faster time back for ten miles more
of the distance from shore, and ten miles at
their speed as contrasted to ten miles at the
liner’s best, compensated for the difference in
rapidity of flight between the Dragonfly and the
faster Dart that could not make the flight.</p>

<p class='c004' >They bade fair to establish a mail ship-to-shore
record.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick sent over the flash-rocket that
signalized their approach.</p>

<p class='c004' >The vessel’s searchlight leaped to life, probed
for and touched their wings, darting swiftly
aside to avoid blinding the pilot.</p>

<p class='c004' >The liner came on at full speed. Don dropped
the nose, cut the gun and approached at an
angle calculated to bring down the amphibian
to the water at a point near, to one side of, and
just ahead of the course the liner pursued.</p>

<p class='c004' >The vessel’s lights looked beautiful, seen
from the air. Chick and Garry thrilled to the
wonderful spectacle. Don’s elation came more
from the precision movements with which the
mail pouches, buoyed with a self-igniting water
flare on the buoy, went over side in the glare of
the liner’s searchlight.</p>

<p class='c004' >Calculated with skill, favored by good
control, Don’s line of descent set the amphibian’s
pontoons on the fairly smooth sea in a line that
sent the liner sweeping by his wingtip with not
a dozen yards to spare.</p>

<p class='c004' >Tossing by in her wake, the buoyed pouches,
accentuated by their marking light, were in a
direct line with the airplane’s course.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry motioned to Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >His part was to clamber to the strut, cling to
a bracing wire, catch up the light buoy.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry’s office was that of observer, to align
Don’s maneuvers with Chick’s activity. Don
had done well, so far: Garry would give him all
the aid he could to complete the maneuver.</p>

<p class='c004' >Seeing them safely past, though shaken by
the ship’s turbulent wake, the man at the
searchlight swung it onto their tail, to give
Chick all the light possible.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick saw the buoy bobbing closer.</p>

<p class='c004' >“A point to the right, Don!” Garry called
into his tube. “He can’t quite reach—that’s
better!”</p>

<p class='c004' >An instant later he spoke again.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Cut the gun, Don!”</p>

<p class='c004' >The Dragonfly, skittering along on the top
of the moiling wake began to settle into it, more
shaken than before by the immersion into a
swirl of cross-currents; but the instant of
delayed speed was all that Chick required.</p>

<p class='c004' >His outreaching hand stretched on straining
muscles.</p>

<p class='c004' >Fingers alert and agile gripped the rope
bound around the buoy.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Full-gun, Don!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Up, and out of the danger of an upset, with
engine roaring, they rose.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, clinging to the mail pouches, held on.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, stretching out his arm, as Chick swung
inboard, caught the buoy and gave Chick the
use of both hands to cling in the increasing blast
of air caused by the climb.</p>

<p class='c004' >Almost, for an instant, Chick’s heart fell into
his flying boots: spray-wet, a wire slipped in
his grasp!</p>

<p class='c004' >“Cut!” Garry called to Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >Leveled, with power reduced, the ship, for an
instant, lost its climb and barely held safe
margins of forward momentum.</p>

<p class='c004' >In that instant Chick mended his grip,
catching a strut.</p>

<p class='c004' >With the mail pouches drawn to the cockpit
floor, with Garry, his hands free, aiding, Chick
got quickly and safely back to his place.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh-kay!” he shrilled, delightedly, as he
snapped on his safety belt.</p>

<p class='c004' >Gunning up at Garry’s relayed signal, Don
made his climbing turn.</p>

<p class='c004' >They were pointing straight for the airport
when he revved up to his full power.</p>

<p class='c004' >The mail flight would be a success.</p>

<p class='c004' >All they had to do was to fly straight, top
speed, set down and be applauded. They need
not cross the swamps of so much mystery and
fear. They could come in from the East,
landing sidewise to the wind. Don flew the distance
to the point where they sighted the airport with
his heart singing to the tune of singing wires,
laughing with the purr of the motor. The
successful termination of the mail flight was in
sight.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then the mystery helicopter struck!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />WAR MANEUVERS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Intent on getting their mail pouch to the
airport in record time, the eyes of Don, Garry and
Chick, in the Dragonfly, were peering forward
and downward to locate the wind-cone, get wind
direction and save every precious second even
during the approach to the runway.</p>

<p class='c004' >Unexpected, startling, disconcerting, there
came, not a hundred feet in front of the nose,
the roaring hiss of a rocket rising to burst, in
a brilliant, eye-stunning flash of vivid white just
ahead.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don instinctively side-slipped.</p>

<p class='c004' >The flash, coming without warning, upset his
self-control, made him think that he might be
plunging his chums into some unseen danger. To
speed into that area of still blazing fire was
unthinkable.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don’s side-slip got the ship away fifty feet:
then he caught the wings, brought the ship to
its forward, level flight.</p>

<p class='c004' >Roaring upward, a second messenger of
terror, with its blazing tail, seemed to be coming
straight under the right wing. Garry, seeing
it, screamed a warning into the helmet
communication tube.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don—one’s coming—bank left!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don kicked rudder, moving the stick to tip
the wings. He gunned up, in the bank.</p>

<p class='c004' >The ship swung, almost on wingtip.</p>

<p class='c004' >Again almost ahead of the new swing, came
that terror from below.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don saw it. He skidded out of the turn by
giving excess rudder, caught the skid, and swiftly
adjusted stick and bar to get on a level keel.</p>

<p class='c004' >His quick wit told him that they were almost
exactly at the altitude where those deadly
fireworks were bursting.</p>

<p class='c004' >In their excited, upset state all three youths
supposed the rockets were the result of some
sort of celebration. The real meaning did not
occur to them.</p>

<p class='c004' >One thing they all realized was that they were
over an area of the utmost danger: no mind
could foresee the track of bomb or rocket.</p>

<p class='c004' >“They don’t see us, don’t know we’re up
here!” Chick muttered as Don planned his next
moves with quick and cool precision. Don had
regained his self-control.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ll dive, to get away with the greatest
speed!” Don had decided.</p>

<p class='c004' >Nose down, engine full speed, he dived.</p>

<p class='c004' >The needle of the altimeter began to hasten
its backward swing.</p>

<p class='c004' >A brilliant shaft of white struck upward,
picking them out, throwing up around them a sea of
vivid illumination.</p>

<p class='c004' >Instantly Don changed his tactics.</p>

<p class='c004' >To level off, as he intended, to come out of
the dive with still a fair margin of altitude to
give him ease of handling well above earth was
impossible. The searchlight might prevent him
from seeing the ground, might blind him.</p>

<p class='c004' >He was plunging straight down toward it.</p>

<p class='c004' >Full-gun, he drew back on the stick. Up tipped
the nose.</p>

<p class='c004' >Wires sang with the fierce wind. The ship
trembled.</p>

<p class='c004' >At nearly two hundred miles an hour the ship
began to climb in the huge arc of a “loop.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don had purpose behind his shift of plan.</p>

<p class='c004' >While he had never executed it in darkness,
he recalled the maneuver known as an
Immelmann Turn, said to have been devised by a
German war ace, by which altitude above an
adversary was gained swiftly, with a change of flying
direction.</p>

<p class='c004' >As the ship soared on its vast curve, it came,
soon, to the top of the loop. It was precisely
“on its back,” upside down. The controls were
heavy, inert in response.</p>

<p class='c004' >Had he maintained control elements in the
same position the engine should have carried
the ship, with its speed almost nil, just to the
point where the nose would have dropped by
engine weight, acted on by gravity.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then, going down on the descending side of
the wide arc, it could be caught, at the bottom
of the loop, leveled, and sent onward.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don did not delay for that to happen.</p>

<p class='c004' >Instead he shifted the stick far to the side,
holding it there.</p>

<p class='c004' >Before the nose dropped, the slight forward
speed enabled the ailerons to act: the wing
dropped, the other came up, and since Don held
the slick steady, the ship, from being on its
back, executed half of a “barrel roll,” so that it
was right side up, and, naturally, at the top of
a big circle, pointing its nose exactly backward
from its original direction.</p>

<p class='c004' >Quickly Don caught the ship’s wings as it
turned on its fore-an-aft axis.</p>

<p class='c004' >Thus he had climbed to the top of a big loop,
had turned the ship from being upside down to
the correct flying position, facing back on the
course.</p>

<p class='c004' >He kept the throttle full open, flying level
for an instant.</p>

<p class='c004' >They were looking away from the search-lamp.
Its beams no longer menaced Don’s clear vision.
Besides, being so much higher, the rays were
spread, diffused.</p>

<p class='c004' >But they were going back, and for all that
Don knew, the force of rockets might still
enable the missiles to reach them.</p>

<p class='c004' >He knew, with sureness, that no chance
celebration accounted for the rockets, by that beam
of light coming up at them from a spot where
no searchlight should have been!</p>

<p class='c004' >He wanted to be doubly safe, to return to the
proper course.</p>

<p class='c004' >He began, almost immediately, a banked turn,
at the same time going upward. In that
climbing turn they both gained altitude and returned
gradually to the proper course. Chick clamped
his gauntleted hands.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Good work!” he screamed in shrill elation.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, too, commended, his voice more
subdued as he realized that his tones went through
a tube directly into ear outlets clamped close
to the young pilot’s head.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Fine, Don!” he complimented the flyer.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don nodded his appreciation.</p>

<p class='c004' >His face, though, was still creased with lines
of concern.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s somebody with a deadly purpose!”
he murmured. “No fireworks were being sent
up for fun. They were meant to upset us. Who
could be so mean? Where did that searchlight
beam come from? The airport? I was too
excited to be able to trace it—right in my eyes,
the way it was.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He peered over the side: the rays were gone.</p>

<p class='c004' >The nose was coming toward its proper
point. Don adjusted his controls. They had
first made a great circle, outward from its
center, and upward in its arc. Then they had
continued to climb, but in an arc that was on
a different plane.</p>

<p class='c004' >It took them far out over the swamp.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, sighting the airport, saw that Don
brought the nose to its proper line with the
revolving beacon as the beam flicked past in its
blinking circuit of the skies.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, staring, with neck craned, over the
side, saw something far more deadly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Garry!” he yelled at the top of his capacity,
“tell Don—helicopter coming—up——”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry caught the call, but not its import.</p>

<p class='c004' >He followed the line of Chick’s pointing arm.</p>

<p class='c004' >Precious seconds were thus expended.</p>

<p class='c004' >The strange, menacing craft gained an
advantage in the delay of locating it and of
discovering its purpose.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don had to be told. Then he was in such a
position that the left wing hid the object of
Garry’s excited explanation.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, over the edge of the wing, saw that the
helicopter, its horizontal blades bringing it
higher, the tractor propeller drawing it
forward, rose toward them on a slanting line that
seemed meant to bring the odd craft up under
their own ship.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, as Don altered the course to get the
wing out of his line of vision, sent over a
parachute flare, lighting up the scene with its white,
revealing gleam.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don saw their adversary.</p>

<p class='c004' >From that had come the rockets: he felt sure
of it. Flung out, or discharged from some
outboard contrivance, their ignition powder had
sent them in calculated proximity to the
Dragonfly—for some deadly purpose!—to put the ship
out of control, no doubt!</p>

<p class='c004' >“There’s a man in that cockpit!” Garry told
Don, better able to see past the swiftly revolving
horizontal blades as Chick’s flare turned night
into day beneath them.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, looking, saw more.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s—it’s—” he could hardly make his lips
form the words. “It’s the—Thing that never—was—the
Man who Never—Lived!”</p>

<p class='c004' >He saw the green of the head covering, the
slick, glistening, formless body in its slippery
oilskins, the flicker of light reflected from shiny
rubber gloves.</p>

<p class='c004' >Up at them came the helicopter, its course
calculated to fall on an angle that would drive them
upward, or turn them away from the airport,
or—if Don sought to side-slip—bring them on a
level with that dreadful Thing at its controls.</p>

<p class='c004' >What then? In any maneuver they could
execute, Don wondered, what would that Thing do?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c002'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />THE SWAMP DEMON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Slow and methodical in his mental processes,
Garry was rather stunned by the situation the
chums were confronting.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, climbing, listened for information. None
came through the Gossport tube.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, alert, with an impulsive quick flash,
got an inspiration.</p>

<p class='c004' >To dive meant going in line with the flight of
bomb or rocket, or—if that strange Thing in the
helicopter really was deadly in its intent—bullets.</p>

<p class='c004' >A side-slip would be no better for them.</p>

<p class='c004' >Their climb did not get them away quickly
enough. Perhaps the Dragonfly had superior
climbing ability, better maneuvering capacity;
but no ship could outfly those messengers of fire—the
rockets!</p>

<p class='c004' >“Garry!” Chick prodded his chum.</p>

<p class='c004' >The older youth turned.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Tell Don—a lot of barrel rolls!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry saw the utility of the maneuver. They
had already executed a half-roll, turning from
upside down to level. One after another, in
succession, a series of barrel rolls would get
them, sidewise, away.</p>

<p class='c004' >They would lose very little altitude.</p>

<p class='c004' >Best of all, the stunt would send them off in
an evolution that would make it almost
impossible to catch them, by angular direction of the
missiles, because Chick knew a variation—and
gave it.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Tell Don—barrel rolls, and reverse rolls!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry realized the value of Chick’s wit,
relayed the idea.</p>

<p class='c004' >Down went a wing. Up went the other.</p>

<p class='c004' >Over and over, the Dragonfly revolved on its
tail-and-nose line.</p>

<p class='c004' >Three rolls followed one another.</p>

<p class='c004' >At the end of the third, Don checked the ship.</p>

<p class='c004' >Down went the nose. Short was the dive, to
gain speed. Up came the nose.</p>

<p class='c004' >With the wing that had swung upward before
now down, he went into a triple reverse roll.</p>

<p class='c004' >On the descent of their dive the dying flare
had shown them the helicopter still climbing.
Its surprised occupant evidently had the large
tube they saw at one side trained at a certain
angle. To change it took time.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don’s reverse maneuver sent them almost
directly underneath the ship.</p>

<p class='c004' >But there their wings were in danger.</p>

<p class='c004' >Checking the ship, Don began the disconcerting,
but very useful stunt termed a “falling
leaf,” in which by alternately dropping one and
then the opposite wing, the ship descended in a
sort of zig-zag drop, much like the erratic course
of a leaf falling from a tree.</p>

<p class='c004' >Twelve hundred feet above the swamp, Don
leveled, and with full-gun on sent the Dragonfly
unerringly down-wind and straight at the
runway approach lights a mile ahead.</p>

<p class='c004' >They must get the mail in, he knew.</p>

<p class='c004' >Swift, at its best, the craft sped toward its
goal.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don cut the gun, began the approach glide.</p>

<p class='c004' >Far behind, unable to keep up, or, perhaps,
giving up the chase, the Demon in the
helicopter—human or otherwise—stayed aloft.</p>

<p class='c004' >Down to the runway in a well-calculated glide
Don swung his ship.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Hooray!” exulted Chick. “Don—Garry—we
win!”</p>

<p class='c004' >The trucks leveled with the tail. The ship
lost speed. Its wheels set their tires on the
concrete and the ship, rumbling, ran forward.</p>

<p class='c004' >Instantly Don cut the gun.</p>

<p class='c004' >Mr. McLeod, the control room chief, and Doc
Morgan ran up.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry tossed out the mail pouches.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The ship-to-shore record is just tied!” cried
McLeod. “Don—I owe you a lot for this—and
your friends, too!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“All right, Uncle!” Don swung about in his
cockpit. “Doc—Mr. Vance—has anything been
done about the Dart?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why—ah—” Doc rubbed his chin as the
older executive, with the control room chief at
his side, raced for the waiting car in which the
mail, still in its sacks, would be rushed to the
New York Post Office, “yes, Don. They got a
new prop set!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Good enough.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why?” asked Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don had not loosened the chin strap of his
helmet. He clambered hastily out of his
cockpit, onto a wing, to the earth.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Who’ll go with me?” he cried, as Garry and
Chick came tumbling out of their places.
“Garry—Chick! Which one?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Where? For what?” asked Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Back to the swamp—to find that Thing and
make sure that it never molests any more
pilots.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I will!” cried Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I will!” Garry’s words were shouted in the
same instant.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No! Only one can go in the two-place Dart!”
said Don. “She’s all fueled up for the flight,
you know, but there aren’t three places.”
“But—” began Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I need one of you for ground work,” Don
cried. “I have a plan! Two of us go aloft, fly
back to the swamp. Maybe we can get there
before the Thing has a chance to set down. Maybe
we can fly around until we locate it. But
somebody has to stay here in the control tower!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why?” asked Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don spoke earnestly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Because—the control room chief took back a
tracing, claiming he owned it—and because
there was the beam of that searchlight on us
tonight—and there isn’t another searchlight that
I know of near!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh!” Garry saw light as Don spoke in his
clipped, alert way.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes!” Chick cried, “you think the control
chief is working with the one in the
helicopter—they are the ones who are trying to
ruin your uncle.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes!” Don was already hurrying into the
wide open hangar, where he saw several
mechanicians adjusting the hub bolts on the small,
swift Dart.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But the chief of control has gone with your
uncle!” Garry objected.</p>

<p class='c004' >They were inside the hangar as Don
answered, putting his words in low, swift earnest
sentences.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Only to the car. He’ll slip back here. We
mustn’t leave him free to signal——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ll stay!” Chick declared. “I’ll stick to him
as tight as his skin, Don. I’ll be a part of the
Airlane Guard—and if he signals, I’ll be there—and
we can get Doc——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No! Trust nobody!” Garry whispered. “Not
even Doc! Don’t forget he was the one in the
boathouse when you found the tracing.”</p>

<p class='c004' >On swift feet Don raced away to the men
completing adjustments on the propeller assembly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’m taking the Dart aloft,” he said quickly.
“Come on, Garry—run her out!”</p>

<p class='c004' >In ten minutes, while Chick watched, and kept
an eye on Doc and on the control chief, who
stood watching in the hangar doorway, Don
revved up the newly warmed engine, lifted the
tailskid from the concrete, the chocks were
dragged from under the wheels, and up from
the runway leaped the Dart, with Garry,
adjusting the Gossport, transferred from the other
craft. They would scotch the Demon of the
Swamps—or do their best to end his
unexplained but menacing career.</p>

<p class='c004' >Stars twinkled in the night sky as they
roared straight for the haunt of mysteries.
And the Demon was ready for them!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c002'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />THE DEMON’S LAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Straight and true Don sent the swift, light
Dart to its mark.</p>

<p class='c004' >Over the swamp they had last seen the
helicopter.</p>

<p class='c004' >In the half hour that had elapsed it could, of
course, be far away. “But I don’t believe it is,”
Garry murmured into his Gossport tube.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, listening, agreed with Garry’s surmise.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Did you notice how that Thing looked while
Chick’s flare burned?” Garry continued his
conversation. “Under the big, bulky body, the
helicopter had two things jutting out—I think they
were pontoons. They have some sort of special
bracing, and shock absorbers, so it can set down
on land; but I am sure that the two projections
were pontoons—and that, Don, tells us that the
helicopter can get down on the water just as
easily as a regulation amphibian.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don agreed as he watched the horizon line
ahead.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That Thing is human,” Garry added.
“Ghosts don’t set off rockets.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Once more Don was in full agreement.</p>

<p class='c004' >They scanned the dark, silent sky around
them and ahead of the nose as they approached,
on swift wings, the scene of their recent struggle
to escape annihilation and to get the mail in
on time.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Not a thing in sight!” Garry checked Don’s
decision.</p>

<p class='c004' >Where had the mystery ship gone?</p>

<p class='c004' >As he asked the question, Garry removed the
speaking tube from his lips and bent his eyes
downward, over the cockpit cowling.</p>

<p class='c004' >He searched the unrevealing water, grass and
ooze of the swamp.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don!” his lips were again at the tube,
“forward of the right wing, just where the fifth
brace connects to the leading edge covering, I
see a little light flickering. There—the wing is
over it. Look! In a second it will be just at
the trailing edge—there it is!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don saw the flicker.</p>

<p class='c004' >As he started downward in a tight spiral, to
keep close over the area and get lower, Garry
spoke quickly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No, Don!” he objected. “Stay high, and go
on away. Then we will climb higher and come
back.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don took the ship out of the tight spiral, but
turned his head inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It might be a lure!” Garry explained.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don saw the logic of his chum’s reasoning:
if the Demon, as he thought of that strange
occupant of the helicopter, wished to draw them
down into a trap, it—or he—would chose such
a ruse.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, lifting the nose, soared away, climbing.</p>

<p class='c004' >A mile away he banked around, and returned.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There it is, again!” Garry, observing,
indicated the flicker. It was more vivid than the
intermittent glow of marsh gas which they saw
in spots where rotted vegetation gave off its
luminous aura.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He is trying to lure us down, I’m sure,”
Garry declared.</p>

<p class='c004' >Adjusting the controls so that the ship,
well-balanced, flew itself for a moment, Don scribbled
a note, passing it to Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t know,” Garry responded, reading
and considering the communication. “It might
be safe and it might not to go down. I know
we can’t get anywhere flying around up here;
but anybody as deadly as that Demon is
dangerous to get close to.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don hesitated.</p>

<p class='c004' >He wished to beard the deadly one in his lair,
to come to close grips; he did not desire to risk
Garry’s safety without his chum’s consent.</p>

<p class='c004' >Nevertheless that was what he had asked for
a volunteer to help him with.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, he knew, was cautious, not cowardly.
Therefore Don hesitated.</p>

<p class='c004' >Once more Garry’s steady voice came to his
ears.</p>

<p class='c004' >“How about doing this?” Garry asked, “let’s
fly away as though we hadn’t seen the lure, get
over the airport, and signal by blinking the flying
lights. The Demon can’t read them that far off,
and we won’t be dropping flares to warn him.
We can tell Chick we have located our ‘bad
man’ and he can get your uncle, with the police,
to surround the marsh. Then we can start
sending over flares, go down, and guide the officers.
They will catch the Demon if he runs, and, by
closing in on all the paths, he can’t get away.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don agreed by switching the nose quickly in
the proper direction.</p>

<p class='c004' >Over the control tower they made a glide.</p>

<p class='c004' >With the flying lights snapping on and off,
Don spelt out a signal to Chick as he held the
Dart in a tight, banked circle.</p>

<p class='c004' >No response came, the control tower remained
unresponsive. Its pilot signal beam, a small
spot, did not flicker on and off to spell the
“O. K.” Don expected from his watching chum.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, as a matter of fact, was otherwise
occupied.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Let’s set down,” Garry suggested. “The
Demon will probably wait, hoping we will go
over again and see his lure. He must have meant
us harm or he wouldn’t have set those rockets
to strike the Dragonfly.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, flashing the “must land” signal of
distress with his blinking flying lights, got no
response: he decided to risk approach without the
signal, and finally tumbled out of the Dart with
Garry already on the ground.</p>

<p class='c004' >Leaving the Dart idling, slipping chocks
under the wheels, Don and Garry hastened into
the big main hangar.</p>

<p class='c004' >It was empty, echoing, deserted.</p>

<p class='c004' >So, too, they found the upper offices.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There has been an awful ‘shindy’ in the
designing department,” Garry whispered,
training his finger, at the door, after flashing on the
office lights. “Somebody has tried to break into
the locked cabinets, and there is a wastebasket
turned over and a chair upset. There must have
been a fight in there.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, looking, agreed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Come on!” he muttered, “something has
happened here. Uncle is in New York, of course.
He hasn’t had time to get back from
delivering the mail we flew in. But where is the
control room crew, and the hangar man, and Doc,
and—Chick?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Up the stairway, not replying, Garry followed
him.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Nobody in here!” Don turned a dismayed,
and frightened, look on his chum, who
responded with equal concern in his face.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Something has happened,” whispered Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >At once he became practical.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don, we can’t stay here to find out what’s
wrong. You want to capture the Demon. Run
down and check your fuel, while I telephone the
police station and report this—and ask for help
on our ‘round-up.’”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don raced back down the stairways.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, rejoining him, a scant ten minutes
later, was very sober.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Chief wasn’t at the station,” he reported.
“Man at desk seemed to be half asleep. Said
the Chief had been called away on a special
errand. Wouldn’t say how soon he could get
help out here. There’s a mystery about all this,
Don. What shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Run up and leave a note for Uncle,” Don
counseled. “I’m filling the tank. If we can’t
get help, we’ll handle this ourselves!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“How?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ll go aloft, fly over the swamp, locate that
area, and act as if I have discovered the lure
for the first time, if it is still there.</p>

<p class='c004' >“And I think the Demon is waiting, sure we’ll
take his bait!” he added.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry scribbled an informing message for
the airport owner, detailing their purpose, and
what they had experienced and the condition of
the airport. Then he rejoined Don, the chocks
were removed, and as he stepped away, with
a wave, Don, alone, sent the Dart aloft.</p>

<p class='c004' >Hardly waiting to see the fleet raft begin its
trip toward the scene of their many mysteries,
Garry hurried down to the wharf and water
runway, down which the land-and-water types
of craft were sent from the hangar: to one side
was a landing stage for passengers from
seaplanes, and at the end of that lay tied the “crash
boat,” a swift, electrically propelled cruising
launch kept always ready in case of any mishaps
to seaplanes or other craft over the bay.</p>

<p class='c004' >To clamber in, unleash the swift craft, and
swing it out from the wharf with its speedy,
quiet motor humming a low, soft drone, was the
work of a moment for Garry, whose assignment
in an emergency was at the speed control of the
“crash boat.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The prow of the speedy vessel turned North,
angling across the inlet to skirt the point of
land he must turn to get to the swampy
channels beyond.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry knew the channels quite well, and, in
the darkness, with only a dim gleam showing
from his small forward light, a double,
red-and-green cruising lantern, he was able to scan the
starry sky and, as he coursed along the shore,
passing the mouths of inviting channels, to
discern, quite low, and inland, the flying lights of
Don’s ship.</p>

<p class='c004' >Their plan was simple.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, cruising, in the air, would discover if
that lure called him, tempted him to set
down—perhaps to some dreadful fate.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, in the silent-motored, and fast little
“crash” launch, would follow the shore to a
channel known as Crab Channel. Down its
somewhat deep and broad course he could turn
inland, coming closest to the scene of their
mission.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then, hidden from inland eyes by tall grass,
he could use a strong flashlamp to signal to Don,
who would be circling wide. If Don saw the
signal, and thus knew that Garry was ready, he
would put out his flying lights. Then, dropping
low, he would circle over the area Garry must
reach.</p>

<p class='c004' >With his own motive power so quiet, Garry
could locate easily the sharp, intermittent
periods of noise as Don alternately fed
full-gun and gunned down. The noise, they knew,
and Don’s low altitude, would fully occupy the
attention of their quarry.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don would hold his tight circle, climbing a
trifle, gliding, keeping his motor alternately
full-gun and still. Garry, creeping in through the
most available channel offshoot, could locate the
object of the ruse and then, surprising him, set
off a self-igniting flare, attack, and at least hold
the Demon, victim of the surprise, until Don
could set down and help make his capture
certain.</p>

<p class='c004' >Everything went smoothly. Garry gave his
signal. Don’s low flying lights winked to
blackness.</p>

<p class='c004' >Over the swamp, two hundred feet up, he
cruised back toward some hidden adversary,
menacing, terrible, watchful.</p>

<p class='c004' >Swiftly, silently, Garry’s light motor impelled
the “crash” launch up a channel which, with his
alert ears guiding him, brought him closer and
closer to the dark spot wherein, from the water
level, he saw a weird sight.</p>

<p class='c004' >Floating on a still, shallow pool, supported
by its queerly designed pontoons, the helicopter
was hardly visible in the shadowy eel grass:
its horizontal blades, tilted by some device to
a vertical line, made only a thin, invisible angle
to the sky, although Garry, from his lower point
of vantage, saw the outline against a starry
background.</p>

<p class='c004' >Intermittently, from the cockpit, and thus
concealed and throwing its beam upward only,
came the periodic flickers of a
handkerchief-wrapped flash torch.</p>

<p class='c004' >Its intermittent, dim glow illuminated the
almost shapeless form and backward-thrown head
of the Thing that never was, the Man Who
Never Lived.</p>

<p class='c004' >Tide-drifted, flare in hand, Garry floated
toward the Demon’s Lair.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c002'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />CHICK TRACES THE TRACING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Seemingly unaware that Chick dogged his
steps, the control room chief, whose initials,
J. V., had proved the baffling tracing to be his
property, went from the runways to his tower
quarters.</p>

<p class='c004' >Doc Morgan, following Chick, appeared at
the door to the control room a minute after the
youth had seated himself unobtrusively, in a
chair in a dark corner.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You might as well go home,” the control
room chief dismissed his assistant who turned
from an observation window where he had stood
scanning the sky, and taking his hat, said
“Goodnight.” His chief, paying no attention to Doc
as the latter lounged in the doorway, walked to
the windows and glanced in several directions
towards the heavens.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick sat quite still. Doc knew he was there,
he saw; but Doc was evidently interested in his
own thoughts, and, beyond giving Chick a
pleasant wink, ignored his presence.</p>

<p class='c004' >Vance, the control chief, assured himself that
there was no immediate need for his services
for landing ships. He adjusted several switches
to leave the essential lighting of approaches
going against Don’s return, and then walked over
to the radio table in one corner.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, watching, saw that the man’s thoughts
were far away from duty.</p>

<p class='c004' >Watching unobtrusively, he saw Vance lean
his head on the hand supported by an elbow on
the table.</p>

<p class='c004' >Doc, still lounging, seemed forgotten, and
appeared to be satisfied.</p>

<p class='c004' >“They are both thinking about the same thing.
That’s my guess,” Chick told himself. “Doc
had something to do with that tracing that
turned up in a boathouse in the marsh, and Mr.
Vance knows it. And Doc knows he knows it,
too! I’ll sit tight and see what happens.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He had no long vigil.</p>

<p class='c004' >Apparently so deep in his thoughts that he
forgot the others, Vance sat in a brown study
for a moment: Chick, quick of eye, observed that
the control chief was not so oblivious as he
pretended.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He’s watching Doc,” he decided.</p>

<p class='c004' >The silence was broken by Doc’s amused
voice.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well, J. V., go ahead and unlock the drawer.
You want to, you do, and you know it, you do
that! Well, go on. Do it! I’d like to know
what that sketch means, I would. Let’s see it
again, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004' >With a start of surprise that Chick sensed as
“acting,” the other looked around quickly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh! Hello! What’s that, Doc?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You heard me.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“About the tracing, it was.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yep.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Rats!” The man leaned back, arms behind
his head, carelessly locking his fingers as he
pretended to laugh. “Doc, you’re pretty interested
in that, aren’t you? Considering where it was
found——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes, considering where it was found—” Doc
repeated the words with a meaning that differed
from the other man’s phrase. “Considering that
it was supposed to be a sketch of a new design
for an airplane, and I saw our young friend,
Chick, discover it when the wind yanked it out
of a drawer—” he forgot his mannerism and
spoke directly, crisply, “I wonder if you go over
there to work on it in secret—eh?”</p>

<p class='c004' >The man swung around in his chair.</p>

<p class='c004' >“As likely as that you go there to hunt
sea-marsh stuff for medicine,” he snapped. “It was
stolen from me, as a matter of fact!” He turned
his eyes on Doc, accusingly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Not by me, brother not by me, not it! No,
sir! You got it back, anyhow, so what’s the
odds how it went? What is it—besides a sketch
of a new aircraft?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick became more alert, more intent: he
had to hold in check his impulse to hitch
forward in his chair. The answer might be
interesting.</p>

<p class='c004' >The control chief laughed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Besides a drawing of an airplane—what
could it be, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Look here!” Doc left the doorsill that had
supported him, and took a few steps closer to
the other man.</p>

<p class='c004' >“See here,” he repeated, “do you recollect
when the engineers were draining the swamp,
and found a skeleton of some poor old codger
who was supposed to be one of the old pirate
band that used to hang around New York, a
good many dozen years ago?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick started. A pirate! He recalled that
the local newspapers had printed several lines
of historical fact, hinting that the bones found
in the swamp might have been a relic of days of
piracy in the harbors and bays, the sea and the
Sound, in and around Long Island and New
York.</p>

<p class='c004' >Suddenly something that had never before
seemed of importance to him flashed across the
youth’s agile mind.</p>

<p class='c004' >Among the piratical names important in
history of activity under the skull and cross-bones,
none had stood out more than that of Morgan.</p>

<p class='c004' >And before him stood a man whose name was
“Doc” Morgan!</p>

<p class='c004' >He suppressed his tendency to utter a cry of
surprise at his discovery; his ears became even
more intent as he held his voice and his
quivering nerves in check.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh, yes, I do recall something about the
skeleton and piracy,” the control chief
remarked, carelessly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well, now, you do, do you? Is that so?”
Doc’s tone was sarcastic. “Do you happen to
recall that pirates used to sail in brigantines,
and such-like ships? Yes, you do! Sure, you do!
And there is a story to the effect that one time
an old brigantine was throwed up onto the mud,
it was, in a gale, off the very swamp where that
skeleton was found!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You don’t say!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I do say!”</p>

<p class='c004' >The control chief was obviously interested.</p>

<p class='c004' >“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Who would know better than a Morgan?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick’s wriggle of excitement went
unobserved.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s so,” Vance remarked. “You are
named the same as one of the old buccaneers, at
that! Say, Doc—tell you the facts:</p>

<p class='c004' >“I was with the engineers when they
discovered that skeleton.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I knew it all the time. So was I.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh, yes—I recollect, you were,” Vance
agreed, while Chick listened and tried to
register in his memory every look, every phrase,
every intonation of the two men. There was
either a fresh mystery leaping to the fore, or
the explanation of many mysteries was about to
come into the light.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well—” Doc paused significantly.</p>

<p class='c004' >Vance cried that he did not understand that
hint.</p>

<p class='c004' >“If you mean that anything was found, you
know as well as I do that nothing was,” he
finished.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No,” Doc argued, coming closer, but no
longer sarcastic. “No, Vance, nothing was
found. But the finding of that skeleton, it
brought out all that about the pirates, it did.
Yes, sir, it did that! And what’s to say all the
talk about the pirates didn’t show
somebody—who—already—had a—map-or chart—that it
meant something!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Let’s see it!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, forgetting the mission he was detailed
to pursue, forgetting his former suspicions of
Doc or of Vance, and intent only on that new
topic—a mysterious, concealed map or chart,
hidden among the intricate lines of a design
supposed to be for an airplane, startled the two
men by his exclamation.</p>

<p class='c004' >Vance, wheeling, studied him a moment,
evidently becoming satisfied that Chick’s interest
was as purely on account of the new idea as was
his own or that of Doc.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why, sure! You’ve seen it, already,
anyhow,” the control chief conceded. “Tell the
truth, you two, I can’t make any more of it
than you did. The day that the skeleton was
found, after you had all gone away, one of the
engineers took me to one side, and said he had
seen a queer thing when he was in the old
boathouse trying to hire a dory, to get to the place
where the skeleton had been discovered, and
where all the excitement was centered. He had
seen a half open drawer in the table there at
the boathouse, and in it was a tracing paper,
pretty old, and seeming to be of an airplane.
It was so curious to see it there that he
mentioned it and I took him in our power
launch—the crash boat—to the scene of the excitement,
and then cruised back to the boathouse for a
look at that tracing. It was just what you’ve
seen. Well, I sat there, all alone, studying it,
but I couldn’t make anything out of it.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He turned and began sorting keys on a bunch
he drew from his trousers as he prepared to
open the drawer of the radio table.</p>

<p class='c004' >“At first I thought what Chick did when he
first saw it. There was part of an aircraft series,
stolen or mislaid and carried there by some
visitor.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Then what did you think, afterward!” Chick
asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I wondered, but I didn’t actually decide
much of anything,” Vance answered. “Well,
you know how a fellow does when he’s
absentminded, studying, or something—draws marks
on paper!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes! I’ve seen you do that when you were
in a brown study,” Chick agreed. “You
draw—let’s see—J. V.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Exactly what I do!” Vance agreed. “Well,
you two, believe it or not, while I sat there,
thinking, I drew my initials on the table, and
one set got on the corner of the tracing. I didn’t
see how it mattered, and I meant to bring the
thing here anyhow. So I let them stand.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But you left it there,” contended Doc, “left
it, you did. Yet you claimed it, you did so, as
yours!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes. I dropped it in the drawer when a hail
came for me to bring the crash launch to help
my boss. I wasn’t control chief then, only an
engineer working out angles and distances
across the swamp for the airport extension,”
Vance declared. “I forgot all about the tracing
until I read in the papers about the piracy and
the hints about lost treasure and all that
folderol. Then, when Chick so kindly brought in the
tracing, I recollected my initials—and there you
are.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick reserved his opinion about the truth
and reasonableness of the explanation.
Certainly it was a point in Vance’s favor that he
was already willingly slipping a key into the
table drawer.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why!—look here!” Vance cried, “this
drawer isn’t—locked!”</p>

<p class='c004' >He dragged it open. At once Chick knew,
just as he saw that Doc realized, that the
tracing was gone.</p>

<p class='c004' >Had Vance made up all that story? Had
someone picked the lock? Was that queerly
disguised tracery of lines more than an airplane
design? Who had it?</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick took no time to puzzle out answers.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Never mind, for now!” he exclaimed. “I
wasn’t such a dummy, after all. While I had
that tracing, before it got lost again I decided
to make a blue-print of it. I did, too!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Good!” exclaimed Vance, and Doc nodded.
“Get it!” he urged.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick ran down the tower stairs. At their
lower steps he stopped, stricken by an uneasy
realization that he had completely shirked the
duties laid on him by Don. He was not
guarding that tower, not seeing what Vance did, not
heeding Doc.</p>

<p class='c004' >Thirteen years—piracy—mysterious
maps—hidden meanings—possibly buried
treasure—the combination had been too much for Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >Should he go back, or go on and get the blue-print?</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’d better go back,” he said. “I can get the
blue-print when the rest are here. Maybe Vance
made all that up, and took advantage of what
I said, just to get me off the scent, to stop me
thinking about watching him. I’ll go back.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He turned to ascend.</p>

<p class='c004' >From the hangars came the crash of an
overturned chair, or some such odd sound. On the
office floor it seemed to be to Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >Furiously racing along the corridor, he
watched for opened doors, in the faint light of
the corridor bulb at the landing.</p>

<p class='c004' >The design room door stood ajar!</p>

<p class='c004' >There he swung in, catching the jamb with a
hand to expedite his turn as he reached the
opening.</p>

<p class='c004' >Inside all was dark, still.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Who’s there?” he called, and listening, heard
no sound.</p>

<p class='c004' >His fingers found the light switch. The room
sprang into brightness.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There’s a chair upset,” Chick called out. “I
know you’re in here. Come out!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Silence met his demand.</p>

<p class='c004' >With quiet feet he advanced, past an
overturned wastebasket, past the filing cabinets.
They had been tampered with—he saw that as
he passed.</p>

<p class='c004' >In a corner was a wash basin, marble, on a
stand, and before it was a Japanese screen to
conceal those who chose to wash.</p>

<p class='c004' >Tiptoeing, Chick advanced close to the screen.</p>

<p class='c004' >Unexpectedly it was thrust over onto him. He
had half expected the maneuver, and he leaped
sidewise and backward, just escaping the edge
of the light frame and the entangling silk
stretched over it.</p>

<p class='c004' >A tall, thin, dark-haired, reddish,
copper-colored youth leaped past him. Caught off
balance, it took Chick half a second to right
himself. Then he was in pursuit, screaming as he
ran. The other was fleeter, longer-legged. He
seemed to have prepared a plan. Chick heard
feet on the tower stairway, thudding down to
his summons. They might intercept the
escaping youth—an Indian, Chick felt assured at
that. He was the faster of the pair, and Chick,
for all his best effort, could not get a grip on
the flying coat.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Indian swerved, in the hall, into an office.
Chick thought he had him cornered until the slam
of intervening doors told that his adversary of
the design room screen episode was out through
the intersecting office suite, and had beaten him.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick ran to the fire escape at a window.</p>

<p class='c004' >Down its iron rungs he went swiftly.</p>

<p class='c004' >A figure, running lightly, crossed the hangar
apron of cement, got to a car. Chick, putting
every ounce of energy into his effort, ran, after
a leap from the fire escape ladder, to try and
reach the car.</p>

<p class='c004' >“This way—he’s going away in a car!” Chick
shouted, to guide the men from the control room.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then he saved his breath, his task being to
get to the car before the youth could get in. It
was a light, cheap make of sedan.</p>

<p class='c004' >Something Garry had told him seemed to
come uppermost in Chick’s mind, some
recollection; but he was too
excited to pause and make sense of it.</p>

<p class='c004' >The motor roared, gears ground into mesh,
the car started.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick’s clutching fingers barely missed the
rear tire.</p>

<p class='c004' >He fell, carried forward by his leap, and lay,
prostrate.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then he lifted his head as the car roared
away, and when Doc Morgan and Vance reached
him, he sat up, smiling.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Let’s take my car!” cried Vance. “Come on,
Chick. Doc, stay and take care of the place.
Get my assistant back to the control room!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes!” urged Chick, running toward the
control chief’s bigger, faster roadster, “I remember
something. Garry was taken to an Indian camp
in that very car, and the very fellow who’s
getting away with blue-prints or tracing is the
Indian’s son who drove Garry back. I know
the license, too. Come on!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />AN AERIAL CAPTURE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Flying low, as though trying to account for
the mysteriously twinkling glow from the
helicopter, Don watched carefully.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There’s the crash boat,” he murmured, as
his sharp eyes made out the dark object against
the sheen of the still water in a channel.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ll ‘give it the gun,’ now,” he decided. “The
noise will drown out Garry’s motor hum.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He opened his throttle.</p>

<p class='c004' >Necessarily he drew further away. That
suited their plan perfectly: it gave him distance
in which to turn for his approach in a position
to come down in a power-stall that would keep
the engine running just fast enough to let the
Dart settle onto the water without too much
forward speed.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry’s hand was on the switch of the
stopped electric motor: in the other he held his
self-igniting flare.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The tide will drift me around that clump of
eel grass,” he told himself, “then——”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, as he saw, was banking around.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Now!” Garry decided that the time was at
hand.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don was coming in.</p>

<p class='c004' >The switch was thrown. The engine hummed,
and forward drove the fast launch.</p>

<p class='c004' >Above the swamp Don began his approach.</p>

<p class='c004' >Surprised by the sudden illumination as
Garry’s flare lighted up the small expanse of
water where the helicopter lay, the Thing in the
disguising oilskins and rubber face mask and
cap and gloves turned to strain eyes through
small cut holes.</p>

<p class='c004' >Gathering speed the boat came toward his
aerial chariot.</p>

<p class='c004' >With a yell that seemed to combine anger
and dismay the Demon swung to the momentum
starter of his motor, sent its disk around
feverishly.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry’s boat swept alongside, the switch on
and gears in reverse to drag it to a stop.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, flying in, kept his engine droning,
settling toward the water.</p>

<p class='c004' >It seemed to both Don and Garry that their
“Demon” was all but a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry cut out the switch, allowing the boat to
drive close.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Give up!” he shouted, to be heard above the
noise of Don’s approach from the air. “We’ve
got you.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The disguised creature gave a shout of
defiance, threw his gears for the revolution that
would wake the helicopter engine to life.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s no use!” Garry cried, as Don, perceiving
the slow turn of the helicopter’s upper blades
as they were rapidly adjusted, lifted the nose
and, instead of coming onto the water, stayed
aloft, waiting, ready to frustrate any effort to
climb away.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry’s hand clutched the pontoon braces.</p>

<p class='c004' >Up he leaped, clinging.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don saw, in the vivid light, the unexpected
thing that happened.</p>

<p class='c004' >Into the water, on the far side of the
helicopter, away from Garry, plunged the queer
creature.</p>

<p class='c004' >Immediately Don cut his power again and
dropped the nose; but he had to bank around to
get in position once more to power-stall down.</p>

<p class='c004' >Watching as he executed the maneuver, he
saw Garry jump away from his position, half
on the helicopter pontoon and half in the boat,
turn as he sprang through the air, and strike
water, with a flash of lighted spray, to begin
swimming with strong, swift strokes, around
the end of a pontoon.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don lost valuable seconds, getting in
approach position.</p>

<p class='c004' >When next he could look, he saw that Garry
was at the edge of the heavier concealing
clumps of eel grass, treading water, hesitating.</p>

<p class='c004' >Down came the Dart.</p>

<p class='c004' >As he took the water Don cut out his power
instantly, to enable him to be heard.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Garry!” he called, “where is he!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Hiding in the grass, I guess!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Wait!” Don knew that Garry could make
no progress trying to swim into that clutching,
restraining mesh of tangled grass blades, tall,
yielding, but gripping arms and legs in any
effort to pass through. “I will get in the crash
boat: he’s hiding. The boat will show him—it
has a spotlight!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, treading water, listened for sounds of
movement in the clump of grass, agreed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You’re captured!” he shouted to the
invisible creature. “You might as well give up and
save trouble.”</p>

<p class='c004' >No answer came.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don saw that the electric-powered boat was
almost within reach as he hurriedly unclasped
his safety belt, clambered onto a brace of his
lightly rocking aircraft, and stretching out his
arm, caught hold of the motor boat’s gunwale.</p>

<p class='c004' >Quickly he got in.</p>

<p class='c004' >To throw in the switch, and to light the small,
but strong, spotlamp in the bow was the work
of but a second.</p>

<p class='c004' >The ray probed across the water, picked out
Garry, treading water, close to the grass where
he had seen his quarry vanish.</p>

<p class='c004' >Picking up momentum to the hum of its
motor, the vessel under Don’s steermanship
moved to a point where Garry could catch its
coaming, and draw himself in.</p>

<p class='c004' >As he deposited his wet body in the bottom,
Don backed water, in a slow, curving course, so
that the small craft was ready, when he cut out
the gears, to be flung forward, with turning
room, in any direction he chose. His hand, on
the light, swung its beam to and fro, sending
scattering, filtered rays through the grass.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I didn’t hear him move away!” Garry was
up and at the bow with Don as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He must be just within the clump of grass.”
Don drew closer, at very low speed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Listen!” Garry gripped Don’s arm. “Did
you hear a shout?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes! Far away!”</p>

<p class='c004' >They were distracted, for an instant, from the
quest by the new and unexpected call coming
from a distant point.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Do you suppose it could be help—for us?”
Garry wondered. “Maybe Chick left the
airport to get police aid.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Let’s wait a bit and see if the shout comes
again!” Don suggested. “This fellow we’re
after can’t go far in that grass; he’d sink into
a mudhole.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Maybe he did, already,” Garry hinted. “Maybe
he went down and got caught in the grass.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That would account for us not seeing&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c004' >“There’s the call—closer, too!”</p>

<p class='c004' >They made out the words.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Sounds like Chick’s voice,” Garry
whispered. He called, high and sharp, “Stop!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes—and there’s a man’s shout—hear
him?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’m sure it’s help!” exclaimed Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But who can they be after?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“They’re coming closer!”</p>

<p class='c004' >A movement of the grass caught Don’s
attention.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There’s—” he began.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No! Listen!” Garry put a hand on his arm,
stopping his sentence.</p>

<p class='c004' >Somewhere not far off, but to the right,
inland, the grass clusters seemed to be agitated
for a moment.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don swung the boat, backing to get room, to
be ready for the new position of their hidden
adversary.</p>

<p class='c004' >The light swung and focused.</p>

<p class='c004' >“See anything, Garry? I don’t!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No, Don—and I’m sorry you backed the way
you did. The helicopter is between us and the
place I saw that fellow disappear——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But——”</p>

<p class='c004' >From a point a hundred yards away came a
hail</p>

<p class='c004' >“Hello! You! Showing a light—who are
you?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don and Garry—Don McLeod at the helm
of the airport crash boat, trying to catch the
fellow who has been haunting the swamps and
the air.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don—Garry!” Chick’s shrill, excited voice
floated to them. “It’s Chick and the control
chief! We’re after an Ind——”</p>

<p class='c004' >The sudden roar of the helicopter engine
drowned the last syllable.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, reaching for the switch, with the other
hand swung his spot beam but it would not
swivel far enough to pick out the helicopter’s
body.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I hear somebody in the water!” gasped
Garry, “Swing—forward, and swing, Don!”</p>

<p class='c004' >The launch, in its position facing the left
bank of the weed and grass-choked channel,
made a difficulty of the forward swing, going
too close to the grass. Its propeller caught in
the grass or mud.</p>

<p class='c004' >Instantly Don cut the ignition to avoid losing
his propeller.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry fled to the stern, bent far, reached
down, began disentangling the snagged part.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Get him!” screeched Garry, to Chick as the
light showed him on the bank of a portion of
the more solid swamp land at the edge of which
the channel ended, far across the sheet of clear
water.</p>

<p class='c004' >From the helicopter there seemed to come a
surprised cry, and the sounds of an altercation.
There was a splash—but the helicopter went
upward!</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, as the propeller was cleared and Garry
shouted that news, did not try to pick up
forward speed again. Instead he gave the motor
its current with gears in reverse, and backed
down toward his own Dart.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What are you doing that for?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Going to the Dart.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But the engine is dead.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s still warm,” Don retorted. “I’m going to
bring down that Demon.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, shouting, appeared at the end of a
path, with the control chief, and guided by Doc,
who knew the swamp trails.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There’s somebody swimming!” he screamed.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don paid no attention.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Watch him!” he called, and then, as the
launch came close to the Dart, caught a wing
and clambered into the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, who took the wheel, ran forward again
until he could revolve the small, fast airplane’s
propeller: as his yell was answered by Don’s
“contact!” he swerved aside, saw the huge
blades begin to swing, heard the roar of the
engine, and hastened to get his launch out of the
path of the oncoming Dart.</p>

<p class='c004' >Swiftly gathering speed, with sharp spurts
of the gun to clear his choked cylinders, Don
lifted his speedy ship into the air, soaring over
Garry’s head as the latter, nosing in at the
path end, took on Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >Up went Don, climbing in as speedy and steep
a banked ascent as he dared with a recently
stopped power plant to consider. He dared not
force the engine until it was again at fullest,
safest operating temperature.</p>

<p class='c004' >The helicopter, rising almost straight up, had
an advantage. But Don did not let that concern
him. His teeth were tight, clenched, with
determination wrinkling his eye-corners.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Demon had gone too far. Evidently he
had meant to lure them in the airplane, only to
“finish them off” in some fashion. Garry’s
unexpected appearance in the launch had upset
those purposes. The Demon, taking advantage
of the new chase, getting back to his craft,
meant to escape, to lie hidden somewhere, ready
to visit more of his menacing attacks on
innocent folk.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Not if I can keep my head,” Don muttered.</p>

<p class='c004' >Swinging in his ever-ascending circles,
spiraling, reversing to avoid that irksome sameness
of turn which might make him dizzy, he kept
going higher.</p>

<p class='c004' >He knew that once he got near the ceiling,
that highest point to which an engine can carry
an airplane, he would be on equal terms with
the Demon, because he could fly past, or execute
some other maneuver, by which his propeller
blast would upset control of those large top
blades, cause the other ship to drop, whereupon,
above it, and ever alert to guard against more
deadly rockets from the improvised “gun” he
saw on the ship’s side, Don could drive down
his foe.</p>

<p class='c004' >To his surprise, before he reached the ceiling,
he came level with the other ship.</p>

<p class='c004' >He saw the pilot, in the moonlight, lift a
hand. Instinctively Don prepared to execute
some dodging stunt; but all that was released
was a white flare.</p>

<p class='c004' >And in its light Don saw the pilot elevating
both hands.</p>

<p class='c004' >It was the gesture of surrender!</p>

<p class='c004' >Tamely enough the other allowed his ship to
settle. Like a shepherd dog circling a flock, Don
went down above the other.</p>

<p class='c004' >When the swamp was once more close beneath
them Don saw that flares were burning, that
torches were lighted in various parts of the
land beside the Demon’s lair.</p>

<p class='c004' >Hardly had the pontoons of the helicopter
plunged into the water before Don had made
his approach, easily guided by the vivid light.</p>

<p class='c004' >As he swung down, contacting the sheet of
water, Don saw, with surprise, that his
adversary was no oilskin-cloaked miscreant.</p>

<p class='c004' >The youth stepping from the helicopter into
the electric launch was coppery of skin, black of
hair. No other occupied the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004' >The launch turned, while Chick and Garry
busied themselves with rope, binding the sullen
son of Ti-O-Ga, the Indian Garry had met.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well,” Vance, the control chief, saluted Don.
“You’ve brought down your prisoner. Wish we
could say as much.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“What happened?” Don asked.</p>

<p class='c004' >As his engine died he listened intently.</p>

<p class='c004' >“When this Indian ran away from the
airport and came here,” Chick explained, “he must
have tried to use the helicopter to get away in.
But the real Demon jumped out as he got in,
letting you go up after the helicopter while he
got away.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But how could he get away?” Don
remonstrated. “There’s only the narrow rim of land,
beyond us, on Crab Channel, then another water
inlet.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Mr. Vance guarded the paths,” Chick
admitted, “and Garry picked me up and we beat
the grass. I don’t know how he could get
away—but he is gone—and with the police to help us
beat this part of the swamp—all we’ve found
is—just nothing!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But he—couldn’t get away!” expostulated
Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Couldn’t he?” said Garry, ruefully. “Well,
then—where shall we look next?”</p>

<p class='c004' >But Don did not hit upon the right answer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />A CONFESSION AND THE CHARM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >All that night they remained on guard.
Taking turns, first Don in the helicopter and Garry
on the shore, then the control chief replacing
Garry and Chick taking Don’s station, they
watched.</p>

<p class='c004' >Not a thing happened.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Indian, sullen, refused to talk.</p>

<p class='c004' >Threats did not seem to disturb him. Pleas
failed to move him. He realized that they had
no way to enforce the threats. None of them
dared to leave the swamps by the paths, taking
him as a prisoner, because it had been his own
familiarity with swamp trails that had led them
safely through, although he refused to say why
or how he had become so well informed.
Besides, as Don argued, they dared not leave the
swamp unguarded.</p>

<p class='c004' >However, they kept a close watch toward the
airport. Don’s surmise that his uncle would
return from delivering the mail, find their note
and institute a search, proved to be correct.
Their flares being all used up in landings,
however, they had no way to signal, and evidently
the airport manager, deprived of Scott’s
services, had no pilot to send aloft as a scout.</p>

<p class='c004' >Early, just after dawn, however, he arrived,
in a rowboat, at the mouth of Crab Channel,
where Garry had driven the electric launch on
his way to summon aid.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Hello!” shouted the older man, laying on his
oars until the launch came up and took him in
tow, “I’ve had the chief of police and his men
busy all night, trying to get reports of any
crack-up, and scouting; but they must not have come
to the lower end of the swamp at all.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He caught a rope flung by Garry who towed
his rowboat up to the scene of their all-night
vigil.</p>

<p class='c004' >Practical, a little sarcastic, Mr. McLeod took
charge.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t suppose it occurred to any of you
that the fellow you tell about had to get here
somehow, and to get away,” he said. “Daylight
makes it clear—see those stakes with the
rope?—that the helicopter has been kept here a long
time. It didn’t occur to you that the fellow
in disguise might have come here in a
dory—and left by the same means!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No, it didn’t!” admitted Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well, boys, that’s what happened.” The
airport executive pointed to the grass, stamped and
bent down, and when they asserted that their
own searching had accomplished the tell-tale
destruction he smiled, led them past the clusters
near the boats, further inshore, showing that
grass had been pushed aside, tangled by the
passage of a body, and then indicated a smaller,
shallower, but practical waterway, diverging
toward the South.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Here are marks of a dory’s nose on the
mud,” he explained. “You have been watching
for a man who calmly sculled or drifted away.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But we couldn’t see that at night,” objected
Chick, “any more than we could see the paths
out of the swamps. Now, I can, though—and
I’m for getting to a telephone, calling the chief
of police, and letting him send a man here to see
about putting this Indian in a cell.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The Indian, not much over nineteen, became
more talkative when this purpose was
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I haven’t done anything really wrong!” he
declared. His English, like his clothing, was
good, showing education and refinement of a
sort.</p>

<p class='c004' >“A year ago,” he said, revealing his identity
as the son of Ti-O-Ga, and named simply John
Tioga, “a year ago a film company came up to
our place to make some films dealing with
Indian witchcraft and dances, for the prologue
of a picture. Father played the old ‘medicine
man’ and I was a sort of magician-devil in the
picture.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t see what that has to do with this,”
began Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It has,” the Indian youth assured him,
sullenly, “because that picture has been released
and shown around, and Father and I have made
a good sum of money, doing what theatrical
people call ‘personal appearances,’ and
showing some magical tricks, as a prologue to the
film showing at different theatres.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He explained the connection between that and
the present situation.</p>

<p class='c004' >“A man has a picture theatre here in your
nearest town,” he told them. “His name is Toby
Tew, and he came up to our place about two
months ago to engage us for a personal
appearance when he shows the picture. We had been
disgusted with the sort of people we met in the
theatres, because they were rough and ready,
not bad, but not especially refined——”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don smiled, thinking of such a statement
coming from the race which had tomahawked and
scalped in pioneer days; but reconsideration
made him realize that the pioneers had slain
also, and had introduced not only “fire water”
but had taken away lands the Indians felt were
theirs. Again, he reflected, the Indian of
culture, with a college education, was far away
from his savage ancestors.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We refused to come here to ‘play’ our
special magical show,” the Indian went on, “but
it wasn’t long after that before another man
from these parts came up to the Catskills—but
he wanted to consult my father about some
hidden or lost object—or—er—things!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Who was he?” demanded Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Called himself Morgan—let’s see——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“‘Doc’ Morgan?” inquired Mr. McLeod.</p>

<p class='c004' >That was the name, the youth acknowledged.
“What had he lost? What did he want to
find? And how could your father help him
locate anything?” asked Garry, quietly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You ought to remember what my father did
with you,” the youth challenged. “Father knows
a great deal about hidden forces of the mind
and of Nature. Sometimes, if his mood is right,
he can do what fortune tellers would call
‘divining’—read the future, or locate articles that
have been hidden or mislaid. Whether he puts
two-and-two together or really can see deeper
than others, I won’t argue with you; but he does
get results. Doc Morgan wanted him to help
him locate a lost ship, said to have been buried
in mud in this swamp——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh—I see how everything begins to fit in!”
cried Garry. “Somebody had a map, or chart,
or plan of some ship supposed to be in this
swamp. Well, then, Doc heard about the
skeleton being found—or saw it found! He read the
news hints about the possible treasure buried
here.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes—and he either found the tracing or saw
it!” agreed Don. “Then he went to the ‘medicine
man,’ because he told us that your father had
taught him all he knew about herb medicines,
John.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Nodding, the Indian added:</p>

<p class='c004' >“But he wanted us to divine where the ship
was buried, and we did our best. Then—when
the two young gentlemen here—” he indicated
Don and Garry—“came there, with their injured
pilot, and Father learned by putting
two-and-two together—or however you choose to say he
did—that there was a stolen tracing of a ship,
we took the contract your theatre man had
offered, and I came on ahead a week ago to look
over the ground and see what was what.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“And what was ‘what?’” demanded Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I can’t give you that answer,” the youth
declared. “I’ve trailed the tracing, but some one
took it before I could get a chance to see it. I
was hiding, listening and watching, in the
airport, this evening—or last night, to be correct.
I heard it said that the map was gone, and I
ran and hid, but the young man you call Chick
discovered me. I was so afraid I’d be accused
of theft of the tracing I’d never seen that I lost
my head and ran—and when I was chased, and
saw something in a disguise going to start into
the air in a helicopter, I swam to it and went
up—and you know the rest.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“All but this!” Don said. “You were close
to that fellow in the disguise. You were in the
helicopter with him——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Only for a minute!” interrupted the Indian
youth, then he checked himself, as though a
sudden idea had occurred to him.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What has struck you?” demanded the
control chief.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I—” the youth hesitated, while Don, Chick
and Garry listened with a feeling that they were
about to hear a revelation.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Go on,” Don prompted.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The—er—Thing was tall.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes!” Chick broke in as Garry opened his
lips to speak.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well, he can fly. It made me think of another
tall man who could fly—and who came to
consult my father when he happened to be away
from home. He said he was a mail pilot, and he
gave the name——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“What?” cried Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Smith!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh!” Garry recognized the flyer mentioned.
“He flies the mail in from Philadelphia. But——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It couldn’t have been Smith who tried to
run us down, tonight,” Chick remonstrated.
“He’s due later on, coming in from Philly. He
goes down Friday and comes back Saturday—and
last night was Friday night.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“He comes in tonight—so he can be left out—unless
he had a substitute fly for him last night,”
said Don, suddenly wondering.</p>

<p class='c004' >They discussed it but made no progress
beyond deciding to investigate the whereabouts
of the mail flyer.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Anyway,” the Indian said, “you should
remember that my father gave you a charm that
would prevent any harm coming to you.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s so!” said Chick. “Garry has been
wearing it, all week.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He stared at the chum he had spoken about.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry’s face was wreathed in a queer
expression, half surprised, half eager.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Golly-glory-gracious!” he exclaimed, “I—had
forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He had.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Do you know?—” he turned to Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What morning is this?” he inquired, with a
grin.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Saturday,” Chick responded for Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes—and what was last night?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Friday night, of course, silly!”</p>

<p class='c004' >But Garry grinned more widely. The others
wondered, but waited.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What has happened on four successive
Friday nights, around Mystery Airport?” he
demanded.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The spook has appeared,” Chick volunteered.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry nodded.</p>

<p class='c004' >“And what did I get to guard us against
spooks?”</p>

<p class='c004' >They remembered the small bag John’s
Indian father had called a “charm” to clip ghost
wings.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What was I to do with it?” asked Garry,
excitedly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You were to wear it all the time—let’s see—for
seven days!”</p>

<p class='c004' >As he spoke, Don caught his breath.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Wear it for seven days—and then open it!”
he cried. “And this is the seventh day—or last
night was the seventh night after our flight!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Nodding, Garry produced the bag from his
shirt, breaking the small cord it was attached
around his neck by.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Now, let’s see—” he began, and tore loose
the wax-sealed neck.</p>

<p class='c004' >They craned closer as he peered inside. His
face dropped, then he discovered something.
Eagerly he extracted from the bag three yellow
oblongs of thin, printed paper.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What in the world?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ll say!” Chick stared. “A charm to clip
ghost wings. Three—free—passes—for—the—Palace—Theatre!”</p>

<p class='c004' >The Indian youth smiled slightly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“My father is a clever man!” he remarked.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c002'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />A CLUE IN SMOKE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >After a somewhat disappointed study of the
three yellow picture theatre passes, Garry
turned to the Indian youth.</p>

<p class='c004' >“John,” asked Garry, “what do these mean?
There isn’t anything on them but printing. They
say, ‘Admit bearer’ and give the Palace name
and they are signed by the theatre manager.
But there isn’t any help there, unless something
is written on the backs in disappearing ink.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Maybe, if we heated them, or wet them,
something would come out,” suggested Chick
hopefully, “as they stand, they are just three
passes.”</p>

<p class='c004' >John, with a quiet smile on his copper-colored
face, replied curtly:</p>

<p class='c004' >“My father is a clever man. He put this with
that, and know much. You try doing that.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Personally,” Mr. McLeod was a trifle
sceptical, “I think they are part of the plot to
confuse you and the rest of us. No doubt the old
‘medicine man’ is clever—clever enough to be
involved in some way and to try to pretend that
he is a helpful chap when his whole attention is
to throw out a smoke screen to protect
himself and—” he frowned at the young Indian,
“—his son.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry put them back in the skin bag, slipped
it into his pocket and switched in the current
to back the launch around.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You might try using those passes,” the
control chief suggested, as the boat moved down
the channel.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry nodded.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We will,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='c004' >With the ignition key and a carburetor needle
and float removed, the helicopter, tied once more
to its stakes, was in no danger of being
removed. They felt that they could safely leave
it: no one would be able to use it with parts so
vital missing. If the owner had a spare switch
key, it was totally unlikely that the carburetor
parts were duplicated.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don’s plan, quietly communicated to his two
friends and to Mr. McLeod, was to be tried.</p>

<p class='c004' >They would leave the disabled helicopter as
it was, go back to their daily tasks in the
designing department of the aircraft plant and the
airport, and keep a watch on the control chief,
on Doc Morgan, and on the swamp, from the
control tower balcony, with strong binoculars.</p>

<p class='c004' >No garage, accessory store or hardware shop
could replace the special carburetor parts for
some time; after instructing their own shop
foreman to report any application for the parts
that might be made to him, Don rode in to Port
Washington with his uncle and visited every
shop, garage and other place where such things
were available, told enough to enlist attention,
without disclosing any of their suspicions about
the tracing and its possible meaning, and
secured a promise to have a report made of any
request for carburetor floats and valves of the
unusual type they had looked up in the
catalogues.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Now,” remarked Don, as their sedan returned
to the airport, “if any spook, or man who calls
himself a thing that never was, comes around
to put his helicopter into commission, we can
grab him, for we will know that no one else
would be after floats like the one we removed.”</p>

<p class='c004' >His uncle nodded, morose and
uncommunicative.</p>

<p class='c004' >Rejoining his chums, Don explained his
recent activities.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I found that the blue-print files had the lock
picked,” Chick told him, “and the blue-print I
made of the sketch was gone.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ve just come down from the tower
balcony,” added Garry. “The helicopter hasn’t
moved. I just barely made out the blades above
the grass. The way they are kept when it isn’t
being used, the blades are sideways to the line
of sight from the control tower. That’s why
none of us, especially since we weren’t
looking for it, ever saw the thing.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Probably Mister Spectre-Man had it there
all during the haunting time,” Chick remarked.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But what did he use it for—and how did he
use it?” objected Don. “The spooky airplanes
were biplanes, old-timers, and there never was a
helicopter in sight.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I suppose he used it to get to his other ships,
and then flew them between a cloud and a light,
so the shadows appeared, just as the shadow
of your Dart showed to us the first night we
tried being Airlane Guards,” Garry suggested.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But why should he hide it in the swamp, and
need it at all? If he had a biplane, he could
take-off from miles away,” Chick argued.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s as much of a puzzle as that mixed-up
affair of a chart that may be an airplane
design, or a camouflaged drawing of a privateer
or old-fashioned brigantine that has treasure
hidden in it,” Chick mused. “Now, we’d better
get to our watching. Doc is my assignment. He’s
eating breakfast, so I’ll go and get some, too.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Control Chief Vance has gone to bed,” Garry
said. “I won’t have very hard work keeping
track of the cottage he lives in, from the
platform where I watch the helicopter. Don, you’ll
be free, then.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well, I’ll work on the inking in of the new
tracings,” the young pilot decided. “Wouldn’t
it be odd if my study of airplane design had
some good effect in clearing up our mysteries?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It certainly would!” agreed Chick, moving
away.</p>

<p class='c004' >While he used square and compass, drawing
pen and India ink, making the perfect outlines
and shading on tracing paper which perfected
the multitude of parts’ designs, before the
working blue-prints were made by Chick and Garry,
Don kept that idea in the back of his head.</p>

<p class='c004' >It would be fine, he mused, to be able to use
the knowledge he had gained, especially about
airplane construction and the creation of the
original plans for new models, to solve the
puzzling, baffling set of unexplained circumstances.</p>

<p class='c004' >The possibility seemed far-fetched, though.</p>

<p class='c004' >“How can it help that I know about
streamlining the body, and the struts, and even the
flying wires?” he asked himself, “or what can I
make of wing-taper, and camber, and all that?”</p>

<p class='c004' >He completed the application of India ink
to the drawing of a seaplane body, in outline,
showing the many braces and their points of
attachment to the longitudinal “keel.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He put it away, with others, in a folder when
it was dry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I guess knowing about designs won’t help,
any more than knowing how to fly a ship was
of any use to the Airlane Guard,” he murmured,
laying the folder aside for Garry’s later use.</p>

<p class='c004' >“If we only had the ‘ignition key’ so we could
make ‘contact,’” he smiled at his application of
aviation terms to their puzzle, “it would be easy
to give it the gun and fly a straight course to the
solutions.”</p>

<p class='c004' >When dusk came on and the chums gathered
to compare notes, the day proved to have
yielded blanks all around.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The Indian told the truth,” Garry reported.
“Your uncle has engaged a private detective
and he checked up. John and old Ti-O-Ga are
‘playing a split week’ engagement at the Palace,
starting Saturday—today. The helicopter
hasn’t been moved. A private detective is
there, watching it, and one is in the hangars.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“We can go to the movies, then,” suggested
Don. “Let’s see if the old ‘medicine man’ meant
anything by giving us passes, and telling us
to take them out of the bag after seven days.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“He might, at that,” Garry became more
animated. “That connects up, because after seven
days he knew he would be here, with his son.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I hadn’t seen it that way,” responded Don.
“Let’s go!”</p>

<p class='c004' >They found the Palace, on a side street, fairly
filled when they presented the three yellow slips
to the door man. Large “cut-out” figures of
Indians, in various poses, and posters, from
“one-sheets” to “flash twenty-four sheets,”
decorated the theatre and billboards nearby,
showing in blatant coloring the scenes from “Red
Blood and Blue.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The doorman, to whom the chums were well
and favorably known, chuckled as he accepted
the “dead-head” tickets.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Papering the house, eh!” he chaffed,
referring to the method by which, issuing free tickets,
a manager sometimes made it appear that his
theatre was well patronized. “Well, you won’t
like the show.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why?” Chick demanded.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s the old story that the fellow who comes
in free does all the ‘knocking,’” responded the
doorman, “I ought not to let you in at all, by
rights. Passes aren’t good on busy week-end
nights; but these are good any time—specials
from the boss. How’d you get them?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“In the most ‘charming’ way you could think
of,” Garry made a hidden reference to the
Indian’s “magic bag.” “They were ‘gave’ to
us.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“All right. Go on!”</p>

<p class='c004' >In they went, finding a trio of seats about
the center of the small and rather old-fashioned
theatre.</p>

<p class='c004' >A comedy was just reaching its end, and the
jet silhouettes of a fantastic kitten, gyrating
across the screen from a kick, punctuated their
arrival with a gale of laughter from the
audience.</p>

<p class='c004' >They were just in time for the
“presentation,” preceding the main attraction.</p>

<p class='c004' >The heavy draperies of the softly lighted
curtain swung down, concealing the stage until the
screen was taken away.</p>

<p class='c004' >Softly the small orchestra began a weird
musical number, while from the projectors that
threw the pictures onto the screen, their lenses
showing colored lights instead through tinted
isinglass disks, came a combined rose and blue
that gave the stage, as the curtains opened, the
effect of dusk coming on just after sunset.</p>

<p class='c004' >Weird tom-toms thudded gently from the
enclosure which pictured a forest background.
Before this, around a small “practical” fire, well
protected, sat some supers, made up as Indians.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There’s John Ti,” murmured Chick to
Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He’s going to sing!”</p>

<p class='c004' >As Garry spoke the young Indian broke into
a chant, with a melodious voice, standing
against the soft light supposed to be the dying
sun’s afterglow over the sea, to one side of the
stage.</p>

<p class='c004' >Three white people came into the scene,
watching, all evidently campers, from their
dress. They were extremely modern, both in
pantomimic actions and in their garments. One
was a girl, the other two were men, and their
attentions to the girl spoke clearly of great
interest in her.</p>

<p class='c004' >To the increasing rapidity of the music after
the song, those make-believe warriors seemed
to be caught by the spirit of some old mood,
and they rose, moving about, presenting a
colorful, barbaric picture as they began a dance, to
the thrum of the piano and the song of violins,
while dull drumbeats punctuated the music.</p>

<p class='c004' >From the wings, as the music became more
wild, appeared the old Indian in blanket,
feathered head-dress and other marks of his
chieftainship.</p>

<p class='c004' >One of the men began to make motions
calculated to show his feeling of superiority toward
the stalking old man, and the girl turned from
him in a sort of distress, then the other man
caught her hand, whereupon his rival glowered,
and his hand moved toward his hip.</p>

<p class='c004' >At once the old chief stretched out an
arm—the dancers drew back and squatted, the chief
approached the fire, beckoning to the girl.</p>

<p class='c004' >She approached slowly, fearfully, and the
music became low as the chief, squatting, drew
out a bag, extracted from it some herbs which
he threw into the fire.</p>

<p class='c004' >At once a great pillar of whitish, dense smoke
rose, straight upward toward the wings.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Clever, isn’t it?” whispered Garry. “They
must have a fan under the trapdoor of the stage,
just below that fire, to make those flames leap
and the smoke go straight up.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It makes me feel sort of creepy, and as if it
was real!” Chick responded. Then they watched,
in surprise.</p>

<p class='c004' >In that white, thick, ascending pillar of smoke,
as though on a screen, there slowly appeared
a vision!</p>

<p class='c004' >There was the girl. There were two men. But
they were Indians.</p>

<p class='c004' >A quick pantomime in the moiling, upcurling
smudge revealed hatred between the men, and
fury when the girl chose the rival.</p>

<p class='c004' >Into that vision blended another so that as
one vanished the other was visible. It showed
the two men, again with the girl, but as they
actually stood on the stage, almost the same in
appearance, as near as the men engaged by the
theatre could be matched to the vision.</p>

<p class='c004' >That picture of hatred was again enacted in
the new garb, and the vision was once more
displaced by another—and the chums gasped.</p>

<p class='c004' >In that smoke column, black against white,
two biplanes flew one after the other toward the
audience—they seemed to merge, to blend, to
vanish, and then—as Chick made an
involuntary little scream of amazement—the smoke was
filled by the vision of two black, bi-winged
shapes coming together.</p>

<p class='c004' >The drone of their arrival filled the theatre:
so realistic was the effect that the planned
scream of the girl on the stage was echoed by
women among the watchers—to the rumble and
roar was added the culminating contact.</p>

<p class='c004' >The vision died as the translucent screen
through which it had all been observed was
gradually lighted by the first scenes of the real
picture, showing the events of the story which
began at the crash.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well!” muttered Don, “did you see what I
saw?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“The very same as the spectre in the cloud!”
agreed Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes,” Chick contributed, “and I see the clue
in the smoke, fellows. Every time that spook
has appeared—it has been a cloudy night!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s it!” Don agreed. “The cloud acted as
a screen—and now we know what was done—a
picture was thrown on a cloud. But how—and
by whom?” He paused. The theatre manager,
passing up the aisle, gave them a pleasant
salute—and all three mentally answered Don’s query!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c002'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />DON TESTS A THEORY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >With one accord the trio of youths hurried
out of the Palace and paused just around the
corner from its lighted marquee.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes, sirree!” Chick spoke the conclusion of a
train of thought that was clear to his comrades,
“Toby Tew is the one!” Don nodded.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He knew about that film they used,” he
declared, “and how the picture was thrown onto
the smoke. They had a picture projecting
machine hidden in the wings, and when the film
was run through it, with a strong light, against
the background of the dark stage, the visions
appeared on the cloud of smoke.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s it!” agreed Garry. “Now that I
come to think about it, I remember that every
night the spectre seemed to appear, there were
clouds. In June there were fleecy, fluffy ones,
and in July they were whitish thunderheads.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“We’d better be sure, though,” Don argued.
“I meant that we may know how the spectre
was made to appear, but that wouldn’t be
evidence in a court if we told Uncle Bruce and he
had Mr. Tew arrested for trying to ruin the
airport by scaring everybody.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But the courts accept what they call
‘precedents,’ I know,” Garry insisted. “If a lawyer
says that another case was decided, before, on
a certain kind of evidence, then the judge has
to decide the same sort of case, on the same
sort of evidence, in the same way.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But how does that help?” Don demanded.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well—look here!” Garry was very earnest.
“I can give you precedents about pictures on
smoke. One night I was taken to a film
showing part of a prizefight, and there were a whole
lot of men in the audience who smoked, so that
the hall had a thick curtain of cigar smoke
between the screen and the projecting
machine—and the picture showed on the smoke—and,
what’s more, the smoke was all glowing between
the lens and where the smoke was so thick that
the picture was clear.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ve read about a picture theatre out in the
desert section of the country,” Chick stated. “I
read it in a moving picture ‘trade’ journal Mr.
Tew loaned me—about a dust storm in Kansas,
I believe it was, where the dust was so thick
in a theatre that the pictures they had to show
appeared on the dust almost as well as on the
screen!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“What of it?” argued Don. “I’m trying to
make you see that proving how a vision is made
to appear doesn’t prove who made it show!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I see your idea!” agreed Chick. “It could
have come from the control room, if the man
on duty happened to have the right kind of
apparatus to use for showing a film and could fix
it to use the powerful airport searchlight.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes,” argued Garry, convincing himself. “I
see that! And Mr. Vance could be there alone,
any time, any night. He could have a projector
‘head’—the thing that snatches the films down
in front of the lenses and then holds them each a
fraction of time before the light to let the image
get itself impressed on your eye. He could fix
it to use the search beam, probably. He’s a
wizard about lighting for night work on airways
and in airports.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Look!” Don pointed down the street.
“There’s his car. He was in the Palace, I think.
Even if we didn’t see him, that’s where he was.
Now I say, let’s get our bicycles and hurry down
to the airport, and look around, before he comes
back to his cottage to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c004' >They hastened to their respective homes,
securing the bicycles. In most instances somebody
gave them a “lift” down to the waterside base,
but each rode well, and was enduring and
speedy on the pedals.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The more I think about it,” Garry stated,
pedaling swiftly and then coasting down the
inclined road toward the water, “the more I think
it over, the less I believe it’s from the control
tower, and the surer I am that Toby Tew is the
man who makes spook pictures on clouds.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“He used the helicopter!” Chick contributed.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don argued his conviction sturdily. How, he
proposed, could a man in a helicopter throw a
picture on a cloud without being seen?</p>

<p class='c004' >“Our Dragonfly and the mail ’plane were the
only ones visible—I didn’t see the helicopter at
all, the night of the ‘spooking,’” he asserted.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No,” Garry admitted, “but, for that matter,
we didn’t see Scott in the Dart. In a black sky,
with lightning flickering to keep your eyes
altering the dilation of the pupils, we might have
missed seeing them; but the helicopter was
there, maybe floating just above the cloud!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It couldn’t have been!” Don was triumphant.
“I drove right into that cloud!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Swinging his handlebars to the left to pass
down the airport road, Garry was silent: Chick,
though, took up the argument.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We can soon find out,” he declared. “We
can search the control room and see if we find
the least thing to back up Don’s notion that it’s
the control chief we have to blame. I think,
myself, Mr. Tew would be foolish—or brazen!—to
show how the thing was done, if he was the
guilty man.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The control tower room was in charge of
Vance’s assistant, who was busy taking down
air condition reports from a radio with a
headset. He nodded, and went on, concentrating his
attention on the weather data which must be
posted—and accurately—on the weather board
in the pilots’ assembling room.</p>

<p class='c004' >With the data typed, the assistant, knowing
that Don was trustworthy and that no scheduled
arrivals would ensue, left the room in the young
pilot’s charge while he departed to post his
notes; and the chance they longed for was made
for them.</p>

<p class='c004' >The search of drawers in the radio table gave
no result.</p>

<p class='c004' >No other section of the drawer space seemed
worth looking into, and since no visible evidence
of any projection apparatus other than the
airport equipment was seen, they felt that prying
was useless.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Nothing for the control chief to use—you
see that!” argued Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I suppose you think he’d have everything
standing right out for everybody to see?” Don
spoke witheringly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well, then,” Chick seemed inclined to take
Garry’s side, to suspect the man who operated
a theatre and, thereby, knew most about the
projection of images from and through moving
picture films.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don sent his eyes from wall to wall, from
cupboard of spare instruments to unlocked desk
drawers.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Tew is the one to blame,” Chick persisted.
“Vance told the truth about that tracing; he put
his initials on it by chance, the way I’d make
little stars in my geography book when I’d try
to memorize the capitals of the South-Central
States.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But—oh, shucks! What’s the good. I don’t
know who it is. I think the control man is more
logical than Toby Tew—and I like Toby best,
too!” Don said, morosely. “But what’s the good
of a theory, any way you look at it, unless
everything fits.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The helicopter didn’t fit in with the idea of
the control room man projecting a moving scene
on a cloud, he argued against his own ideas:
at the same time, the helicopter failed to
connect a theatre owner and boatman with such an
idea. The picture on a cloud could have been
evolved by either, since both knew about the
angles of projection and the properties of light,
concentration, angle and diffusion. But Doc
Morgan had also acted in a suspicious manner,
and certainly knew about the treasure, which,
in itself, failed to fit in with the theory of Tew
trying to ruin airport business for spite against
its executive.</p>

<p class='c004' >Coming back, the control assistant asked Don
if he would stay until the assistant slipped
across the runways to his boarding place for
a ten o’clock cup of coffee and some cold lunch.
Don agreed.</p>

<p class='c004' >Getting his coat, the assistant caught his arm
in an older garment hanging on a peg, and it
fell to the floor.</p>

<p class='c004' >They all heard the clink and jingle of some
metallic object as it flew out of the vest hung
under the coat and also dislodged.</p>

<p class='c004' >The man bent, picking it up.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What’s this?” he wondered aloud. “The
Chief ought not to have keys loose like that in
his old duds—Doc might knock them down the
way I did and be too busy mooning over
something to hear the noise—and a key would be
lost.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Golly-to-Chriminety!” exclaimed Chick,
running across to him, “let’s see that key, Chubby!
It might be that it fits the cabinet where I keep
the blue-prints—the one the blue-print of the
ship plan was taken out of.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh, no! The Chief isn’t that sort. Anyway
he lost a tracing, too!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t accuse him of that!” there was a
hidden meaning in Chick’s tone, “but somebody
might have put this where you found it!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s right! Here! Try it!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don remained on duty, allowed the man to
depart, and then waited expectantly while Chick
rushed away on his errand.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, on the balcony, using the binoculars
to try and locate the helicopter’s upthrusting
blades, heard his name called.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Garr—ry!” The hail came from the lower
floor.</p>

<p class='c004' >He raced down the stairway.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, waiting, impatiently tried to hear the
words that seemed to come up in excited, quick
calls of amazement.</p>

<p class='c004' >Soon his comrades came stamping up the
stairs.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The key didn’t fit the cabinets!” Chick set
down the large black leather case he had been
dragging along, and puffed for breath.
“But—it—did—fit—one—of—the lockers—in the pilots’
locker room!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oho!” Garry came after his smaller
companion, dragging a compact and
intricate-looking mechanism. Don, staring,
recognized it.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s a projector ‘head!’” he said
excitedly. “And you found it, in a pilots’ locker—whose?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh! I don’t know that,” Chick argued. “I
think it’s a spare one. What does it matter!
The key was in the chief’s vest, the one he puts
on when he is working around in here. What
more proof do you want! You argued that he
was guilty of throwing the spook pictures!
Well——”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, examining the projector apparatus,
which comprised an upper canister, or flat
magazine, into which a reel of film could be
placed, a film guide, a ‘gate’ and aperture, with
mechanism for snatching the film through, and
its lower guide and magazine, looked up.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Open that leather case.”</p>

<p class='c004' >It was only snapped shut, not locked. Chick
and Garry got back the lid in short order.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Here’s a roll of film.” Chick drew it out,
opening the tin container protecting the
celluloid material from drying out or from
chance of fire. “It’s—an—aviation scene——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“And the key to the locker was in the chief’s
vest!” chanted Garry. “Your theory was right,
Don.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’m not so sure!” Don looked from the film
to the projector. “It looks black for him,
but—Garry how would you concentrate enough light
from the big, open spot lantern here, onto the
aperture of the projector head? See! The lens
in that spot lamp is at least eighteen inches
across, and that’s the diameter of the beam it
throws. The part of the projector that the
light has to concentrate on is less than two
inches across! How about it?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I can’t tell you.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It was your theory, Don,” Chick reminded
him. “Now you’ve got ‘evidence.’ You find
out how it’s used.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I will!” Don accepted the challenge.</p>

<p class='c004' >Studying the situation, the lighting
conditions, and the materials at hand, he jumped up,
turning an excited face to his comrades.</p>

<p class='c004' >“This is how I’ll prove my theory—or test it,
anyway,” he asserted. “Chick, rush down to the
designing room, and get the big focusing cloth
you use to cover your head when you have to
focus the enlarging camera for detail print
enlargements. Bring it up.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick was back very soon with the big,
rubberized square of black.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Now,” Don came from an adjoining room
where they had discarded flying togs that
morning, “I’ll take the Dart, and go aloft—and fly
out over the swamps. Chick, you and Garry
adjust that focusing cloth over the projector head
so it cuts off all the stray light that the beam
lens won’t concentrate on the aperture plate.
Then, when I set off a green Verey light, and
it goes out and I have time to get my eyes
used to the dark again, you open up the beam,
and start turning the projector, with this film
in it, trained on a cloud near where I am. We’ll
soon test my theory.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He got a mechanician, half asleep in the
lonely hangar shops, had his help to start up
the refueled Dart, warmed up the light ship,
and signaling for the “mech” to release the
tail he had been steadying against propeller
blast, on the runway, Don sent the small craft
into the water, taxied along its gently ruffled
surface, got on the step and with full gun went
soaring up to test a theory.</p>

<p class='c004' >Short was his turn and abrupt his wingtip
bank, to get himself headed for the marshes.</p>

<p class='c004' >There, with a chosen altitude that he judged
to be right for the angle of projection, he made
ready to see if the tower beam had sufficient
concentration and intensity to make a ghost of a
film picture show on the cloud its beam might
strike.</p>

<p class='c004' >The green Verey flashed out, burned and died.</p>

<p class='c004' >Gliding, watchful, Don’s eyes accustomed
themselves to the dark.</p>

<p class='c004' >A moment passed. Then, as he banked to
come back, he saw it.</p>

<p class='c004' >From a luminous cloud the spectre ship flew
out at him!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />A QUESTION OF ANGLES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Without wasting an instant, when he saw the
silhouette of the spectre in the cloud, Don fired
the Verey pistol set at the side of his airplane.</p>

<p class='c004' >Arranged for the discharge of the Verey
lights, the implement, fixed at one side of the
fuselage, sent out into the air a bright, white
flash.</p>

<p class='c004' >The smoke bomb that Don used was such as
pilots employ to show them wind direction. The
light was almost instantly gone, being succeeded
by the liberation of a dense volume of smoke
that drifted in the light Summer breeze. But
Don was not concerned with the smoke: he knew
that watchful eyes had been ready to catch the
flash, through the dark.</p>

<p class='c004' >“They know, in the control room, that I got
what I came for,” he told himself. “Now they’ll
shut off the light and get everything put away
before the control man returns from his late
supper.”</p>

<p class='c004' >With quick hands he set the controls to swing
back, and made the return trip in as brief a
space of time as the Dart’s power permitted.</p>

<p class='c004' >At the runway, as he came to rest, Chick ran
up.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We got your flash!” he said, keeping his
voice low. “Garry’s putting back the things.
Let’s get the Dart back. You’ll have to explain
the flight to the control man. He must have
heard the take-off and landing.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Right. Well, Chick, one thing is settled,
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“One thing? You mean——”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, unsnapping his helmet chin strap, put
his lips close to Chick’s ear and spoke very
earnestly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The spectre appeared. But!—it wasn’t from
your projector!”</p>

<p class='c004' >If he expected a cry of surprise, as his grip
on Chick’s arm for a warning seemed to
indicate, he was, himself, surprised.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We know it,” Chick, to Don’s amazement
remarked.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You do? Then you saw it?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No, Don. Come on. Let’s not talk till we
get back to Garry.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He led the way to the stairs, and instead of
going on to the control tower, turned aside at
the door to the lower corridor.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Let’s go into the designing department,” he
suggested. “As soon as the control man returns,
Garry will meet us there.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Just where I meant to go.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Together they entered the room, lighting its
dome bulbs.</p>

<p class='c004' >“As soon as I saw the picture on the cloud,”
Don stated, “I knew it didn’t come from the
control room.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“How did you find that out!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, at the table, took pencil and paper.</p>

<p class='c004' >While he sketched rapidly Garry entered.
Chick put him in possession of Don’s news.</p>

<p class='c004' >Watching, Garry nodded.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don knew, from the light angle, I guess,” he
whispered.</p>

<p class='c004' >The sketch Don made was proof of his
accuracy of judgment.</p>

<p class='c004' >It showed a small airplane, as though viewed
from above. Its nose was directed toward a
sketchy line that indicated the shore of the bay.</p>

<p class='c004' >A little in front of its nose Don had made a
small indication of a cloud. On that he put a
straight line, that the others saw was meant
to represent the “screen,” or place where the
picture had been seen.</p>

<p class='c004' >And the airport control room when he
sketched it in, lay at exact right angles to that
screen line!</p>

<p class='c004' >“As the nose pointed West,” Don said,
excitedly, “the light from your projector, coming
from the South, would have been on the South
part of the cloud. But the picture was on the
East side, the one I faced. That’s how I knew
you didn’t throw the picture. Besides, as I saw
earlier, the diffused light from your beam, as it
touched a cloud before the picture appeared,
was very faint!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Q. E. D.” Chick quoted his school algebraic
phrase.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But if I saw the picture facing toward the
West, how could you see it from the South!”
asked Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We didn’t!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Then how did you know, Garry? What
proved you didn’t project it?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry answered slowly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The film we had,” he explained, “started off
with a couple of ‘shots’ of airplanes—flying
over our swamp. But then it became a series
of moving pictures, taken from the air, of water
and marsh.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“And that was all,” Chick added.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The more things I see,” Don said after a
long moment of thought, “the more I begin to
think that Indian, John, had the right idea.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“About Smith—the mail flyer?” Garry asked.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“We will see a little later,” Chick stated. “His
’plane comes in after awhile.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don’t forget,” Don argued, “that a man
clever enough to do all the things we have seen
done is bright enough to have somebody else
fly his mail close to this airport, set down, and
let Smith take it over and bring it in. For
money, and with a man far enough away, it
would be possible—and we could never check it
up.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“He’s still in that swamp, close by,” Don
argued. “He is as brazen as they come, too!”
Chick wondered audibly why Don had not
flown straight up “to catch the man.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Alone?” Garry defended Don from a hint of
caution. “Don did the right thing, coming back
here. The stores haven’t reported a call for
spare carburetor parts. The man is clever.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Maybe he got spare parts at Bennett Field,
or Roosevelt Field,” Chick suggested.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don held up a hand and shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It isn’t important, just now,” Don declared.
“Let’s make sure how the picture was thrown,
tonight, while I flew around. Then we can work
out why there is this extra projector head and a
misfit airplane crash picture afterward, and
about the carburetor.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well, if you looked around, you must have
seen the crate that the ‘ghost’ used,” Chick
inferred.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c004' >They knew that he had not been careless: had
a ship been in sight his sharp eyes, looking for
just that, would have noted it.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Listen,” Garry drew up a chair by the table,
“Don, your knowledge of angles, and the things
you had to study about angle of attack of a
wing, and angles of incidence of air and wing,
and all that, ought to help out here. This seems
to be a question of angles.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It does,” Chick agreed. “What’s more,
Garry, you’ve studied about light, because I
know the control chief gave you some books
when he saw that you took an interest in his
work.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Maybe we can both get something out of
what we’ve learned,” Don admitted. “Now—how?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well,” Chick offered an opinion, “the old
Indian gave us passes that showed us ‘how’ the
ghost could be worked. Maybe there is a clue
to ‘where from.’”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes—I think there is!” Don caught a fresh
sheet of paper, and began to draw a rough
diagram of the theatre stage, sketching in the
position of the pillar of smoke broadly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“From what we’ve proved, about tonight, the
stage picture couldn’t have come from the
wings,” he stated. “It would have to fall on the
smoke from the front, almost, or else the people
in side seats might see it and not those in direct
line, from in front of it.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry drew the sheet to him, made an
addition, showing the projection room of the Palace,
up on its balcony.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The theatre was made very dark,” he said,
“and all the light on the stage was adjusted so
that the sunset died out when the pillar of
smoke went upward. Then the man at the film
projectors in the balcony ‘faded in’ the
picture—from in front, and at an angle ‘above’ the
audience.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don jumped up, upsetting his chair in his
excitement.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Knowledge is Power!” he cried, excitedly.
“Study of angles has given us the answer to
Chick’s ‘where from!’ That shows why there is
a helicopter hidden in the marsh!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I see it!” Chick was equally animated.
“With the helicopter, the ‘ghost’ projector could
hover above the clouds, well hidden.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes, and ‘throw down’ from that makeshift
‘projection room’ onto a cloud,” exclaimed
Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He could hover very high,” Don contributed.
“There he could see an airplane, coming, at a
distance, gauge its direction, swing his own ship
and descend to a point over a cloud. Hidden
there, with his light on, and his film going
through, the spectre would appear on smoke or
clouds right in front of the coming airplane.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s exactly how, and from where, the
ghost comes!” Garry agreed. “Now, here’s a
suggestion, Don! Let’s ‘show’ everybody!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t quite see—” began the young pilot.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s almost midnight.” Garry consulted his
wrist watch. “The Palace has finished the
second show. The control chief and the others will
all come here to see that everything is right,
and for the arrival of the midnight passenger
’plane from the Maine Summer resorts. I’ll
stay here and you, Don, and Chick, take the
Dart, fly to where the helicopter is, with the
projector and film, and when I give a beam signal
that they are here, you two, in the helicopter,
pick a cloud they can all see, and ‘put on your
show.’ The minute that everybody sees how
simply it is done, the ghost’s claws will be
pulled—no pilot will be afraid and maybe—maybe
your uncle will get a whale of a lot of business.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes!” Chick was enthused. “And Garry can
see whose face betrays guilty knowledge, when
the actual ‘spook’ is projected.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But—” Don saw the difficulties, “this isn’t
the same film, hidden in the locker. Besides—where
will we get the light?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“The ‘ghost’ must get light from somewhere—”
Chick began.</p>

<p class='c004' >A flash of inspiration made him bang his palm
on the table.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The boathouse!” he exclaimed. “Don—Garry!
I saw the Man who Never Lived come
up from under that boathouse. That’s where
he stores all his real stuff—light, and film, and
maybe another projector, complete! This one is
just in case he is suspected—to mix up the
trails!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I believe Chick has the right idea!” Garry
conceded.</p>

<p class='c004' >“So do I! Come on, Chick! We’ll ‘put on a
show’ and clear up the airport mystery of the
spectre in the clouds for once and all!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Again the faithful Dart, with two youthful
occupants, took to the air.</p>

<p class='c004' >And someone, behind the screen at the wash
basin in the designing room, smiled, waited
until Garry left for the control room, and then
strolled nonchalantly back to the cottage where
he roomed, and went peacefully to his quarters.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There won’t be any more need for the
ghost,” remarked the quietly smiling person to
his shaving mirror. “Tomorrow the boys will be
busy getting out of this little experiment—the
engineers won’t be working, and it ought to be
easy to find the chest that must have been buried
when the mud in Crab Channel sucked down the
brigantine, <i>Lady O’ Fortune</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don and Chick, in the Dart, drove on,
full-gun, to help his prophecy come true.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />DARING AND DISASTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Careless of the attention they might attract,
Don and Chick rode the low altitudes toward the
sheet of water before the boathouse. Chick had
a parachute flare ready.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don signaled.</p>

<p class='c004' >Overside went the flare, to ignite and throw
its fierce, white glare over the approach.</p>

<p class='c004' >As it settled Don spiraled down, far enough
away to make his pass at the water, power-stalling
to a safe drop onto the surface.</p>

<p class='c004' >He gunned the engine enough to bring them
close to the old wharf and then let the incoming
tide drift them, while Chick, out on a pontoon,
sidewise to the piling, caught the rope they had
cut and left hanging some nights earlier.</p>

<p class='c004' >To draw the ship closer was no task.</p>

<p class='c004' >Securing it, and taking the precaution of
pocketing the parts previously removed from
the helicopter carburetor, Don passed them up
to Chick, whose agility had enabled him to reach
the planking of the dock.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Now,” Don helped by Chick, made the level
and drew a small flashlamp out of his coat,
“let’s see, first, if anybody’s up here.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The light of the small torch danced to and
fro as they stood in the open door of the old
building.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Nobody at home!” Chick declared, following
the light into corners, behind the table, still
lying on its side where it had been overthrown
in the former struggles, and lifting the trap in
the dark corner.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Down we go!” Don whispered.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Nothing to stop us.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Their light, showing a rusting iron ladder,
also revealed the surface of stagnant water,
around a small landing stage, built to float up
and down with the tide. Around it, thickly
clustered, were the dozen dories owned by Toby Tew.</p>

<p class='c004' >Boards, on the lee side, nailed to the
string-pieces, served to keep wind out in storms, and
since the boarding was carried down below the
tide marks, disturbances from wind drift did
not much affect the tethered crabbing boats.</p>

<p class='c004' >“If we find anything,” Don held the light while
Chick descended, head bent to screen his eyes,
“if we find a projector, and a battery, it will
narrow down our suspicions to Toby, and point
to him after all.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It will!” Chick agreed, reaching up to take
the light, then jumping from the lower rungs
of the hanging ladder which did not quite go
down to the platform, allowing for its rise with
the tide.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Here I come!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, with Chick lighting his way, made the
climb and jump.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Nothing on the platform,” remarked Chick
sending the beam to and fro.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Put it on the dories—that’s it. There!”</p>

<p class='c004' >A note of triumph was in Don’s voice.</p>

<p class='c004' >They hurried to the edge of the platform,
drew a dory close, and were quickly within its
cluttered hull.</p>

<p class='c004' >A tarpaulin, dragged aside, revealed, in the
light, a good-sized box-like metallic contrivance,
its sides rounded, with a sort of chimney on top:
there was, besides, a large, circular tank, and a
smalled metal case.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Here’s a portable projector,” Don identified
the metallic object, “and there is the ‘head’ and
probably film, in that smaller case. But where
does he get his light?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Maybe that tank holds acetylene gas,”
suggested Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, unfastening the projector lamp-house,
exclaimed in elation.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I know!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c004' >The round, pure white object set in a holder
within the lamp-house, identified by Don as a
calcium disk, told him the source of light.</p>

<p class='c004' >“This calcium gives the whitest, most
brilliant light there is,” he declared. “See, Chick!
The tank probably contains oxygen, under a
strong pressure. Yes—there’s a gauge, and a
pet-cock to regulate the gas flow. The tank
connects, by this rubber hose, to the base of the
burner, and the thing on the lamp, like a bent
finger, pointing toward the calcium disk, is to
throw the oxygen jet onto its surface. Then
it glares like all get-out!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Let’s row the dory, and never mind the
Dart: she’ll stay put,” Chick found oars on the
staging in a big box.</p>

<p class='c004' >They found quite a direct channel, along the
shore line from the boathouse to the position
in which the helicopter still lay tethered.</p>

<p class='c004' >Expertly, as Chick obeyed his orders, Don
assembled the parts of the apparatus in the
cockpit of the helicopter. Iron, or perhaps aluminum,
pieces, set into the coaming, enabled them to
attach the portable projector, and to swing it to
and fro, and direct it up and down.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Did you ever fly a helicopter before?” Chick
asked, as they perfected the connections between
tank and the lamp base.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No. But it’s simple! I mean—I can do it!
You see, Chick, my flying experience will let me
handle the tractor propeller, just the same as in
the Dart.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I suppose so! And I see that all you have
to do about the top set of blades is to throw in
a clutch that meshes the gears on the upright
mast. The mast is set in a step and bearing in
the body frame. It is squared into the gear
that turns it—I guess you can manage it.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don agreed.</p>

<p class='c004' >Nevertheless, being a cautious youth who
believed in being forehanded, he went over the
curious, squat fuselage, tracing gas, oil,
water-cooling and other feeds and piping. Then he
examined the engine. Except that it was of a
make he had not handled, it offered no
difficulties.</p>

<p class='c004' >Assuring himself that the gas gauge indicated
at least several hours of fuel supply, and that
he understood the controls for the lifting
mechanism, Don operated the momentum starter.
Its handle, rapidly rotated, gave a big, heavy
wheel considerable momentum. Then,
applying its control, he transmitted the power thus
achieved to the engine and after several
attempts the starter caused the charge in a
cylinder to be ignited as the flywheel turned onto a
point where a firing current passed into a
charge of fuel mixture.</p>

<p class='c004' >At once the engine took up its revolutions.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don manipulated the throttle until he became
fairly conversant with the power response, then,
carefully, being sure that all was well, and that
they had the film already threaded properly in
the projector and that Chick comprehended the
handling of the fuel for the lamp jet, he eased
down the engine, let in the upper blade clutch,
and saw the mast whirl its fan-like top slowly.</p>

<p class='c004' >Gradually, as Chick cast loose the ropes, Don
increased the speed of the upper blades, leaving
the forward propeller idle.</p>

<p class='c004' >The speed of the rotating fan soon began to
be felt; but they did not rise.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don!” Chick, sensed a solution, having
studied a good deal about the various points
of airplane design, “remember that when a
pontoon is in water, as it lifts, the suction of the
surface increases and has a strong pull to keep
it from leaving: that’s why they design a
pontoon with a ‘step’ so the contact is with the top
of the water, and not down in it.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s right,” Don agreed. “We’ll have to
go forward a little as we lift. On land that
wouldn’t be necessary. In water it may.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The experiment was tried: he used the
thrust-propeller, and in short order they were rising:
then he cut out the forward speed, until he had
made some tests of lifting speed with the
horizontal blades.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Here we go!” he cried finally. Go they did—up
and forward.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Aside from the handling of the upper fan,”
he mused, “this isn’t much different from a slow
cruising airplane. The tail and propeller
control are similar—rudder and elevators; but I’ll
have to remember the turn is made without
ailerons to bank. We don’t have to bank on
a turn. We just rudder around, and the upper
blades keep us on a stable keel as we turn—here,
we do it!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Around swung the forward propeller, and
Don directed the craft toward the higher levels
on a slanting line that climbed it and also
progressed it toward the airport.</p>

<p class='c004' >He saw, when they came close to the open
space, figures on the illuminated tower balcony,
watching upward.</p>

<p class='c004' >Someone blinked a flash lamp.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That means ‘O.K.’” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We can put on our show!” cried Chick, also
misinterpreting the signal that they did not
pause to spell out in full.</p>

<p class='c004' >Swiftly, with the engine gunned in, Don lifted
the helicopter above the small groups of fluffy,
white cloud that gave him excuse for his
experiment. The airport vanished beneath the mist
and the shrouding clusters of dense,
smoky-white vapor.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don swung the nose, as they hovered,
drifting only slightly.</p>

<p class='c004' >Thus he maneuvered into a position where
his understanding of the angles they had worked
out enabled Chick to train the projector on a
mass of white vapor just over the edge of the
bay.</p>

<p class='c004' >He threw up his arm.</p>

<p class='c004' >The beam of the white light glowed, and
Chick quickly maneuvered it, through a
threaded-up section of transparent, non-inflammable
film, into the cloud. He began to
turn the crank. Darkness ensued in the cloud
as part of an opaque film covered the light.</p>

<p class='c004' >Suddenly Don screamed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Stop!”</p>

<p class='c004' >He threw up his arm, trying to signal Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >But the younger chum, intent on his handling
of the intense light and the focusing tube of the
lenses, as well as the proper course of the film
as it jerked downward, paid no attention, failed
to hear the cry and did not see the signal, his
eyes being turned downward and away.</p>

<p class='c004' >From the airport came screeches, as of warning,
terror or distress.</p>

<p class='c004' >The crash siren was going!</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, from their high point, looking alertly
around the horizon, had observed that the
midnight mail ’plane, behind schedule, was
coming, low and fast, over the swamp.</p>

<p class='c004' >It all happened in a few instants.</p>

<p class='c004' >On came the mail ’plane.</p>

<p class='c004' >Up above the clouds, hidden from the mail
ship by vapor, Chick cranked his projector.</p>

<p class='c004' >As the mail ship approached, near the edge
of the swamp, out on the cloud leaped the glow
that suffused it, went through it, made of it a
weird, terrifying set of illuminated atoms of
moisture. Onto that plane of light leaped the
black silhouette of an oncoming ship. The swing
Don tried to make, to turn the vision away from
its screen, did not help, since they had no
forward speed to cause the rudder to work.</p>

<p class='c004' >Hideous terrors gripped the young pilot. He
knew what was about to happen. The pilot of
the mail ship, already superstitious, and aware
of the ghostly stories that had been flung far
and wide, would look toward that cloud as he
dropped the nose toward the airport approaches.</p>

<p class='c004' >It couldn’t be helped. The spectre in the
clouds was flying right at him as his ship
disappeared from Don’s sight under the cloud over
which they hovered.</p>

<p class='c004' >Swiftly he cut the speed of the upper blades.
They began to settle.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What will we find on the ground?” Don
muttered.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />AVENGING WINGS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Soon after Don flew away with his younger
chum, Garry was rejoined by the control
assistant. They sat talking for some time: then, as
Garry’s frequent trips to the balcony became
noticeable, the man asked their reason and
Garry explained their intention.</p>

<p class='c004' >While he finished his story, the control chief,
Vance, with Doc Morgan, came out from town,
in the former’s car: soon afterward Mr.
McLeod drove back from his trip with the mail.</p>

<p class='c004' >The airport executive was in high spirits.
When, however, Garry detailed his story, the
face of Don’s uncle took on a serious look.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don knows nothing about helicopters,” he
declared. “Besides, this isn’t the way to
accomplish results. I have detectives watching.
If you had given them all this information it
would have been better than for Don to try to
‘show up’ the trick. That warns the real
perpetrator, puts him on his guard. The
detectives could probably have caught him.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That wasn’t the worst feature,” the control
chief volunteered.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The mail ’bus is due in half an hour,” he
declared. “Suppose that hair-brained nephew of
yours decides to ‘put on his act’ just as it is
coming in?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Startled, Garry saw the force of the
argument.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don is going to have the helicopter over the
airport till he gets a signal and gives one,” he
asserted. “I’ll signal him to come down, to give
up the idea.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Then, as another thought came to him, he
added:</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’d better get the Dragonfly warmed up and
on one of the outgoing runways, sir. If
anything should compel Don to land in the bay or
the swamp—or if he didn’t recognize my
signal—I could manage to fly the ‘crate’ that
far—I’ve had fifteen hours solo in her.”</p>

<p class='c004' >To that the others agreed, including the
private detectives summoned from various posts
about the airport where they were on watch.</p>

<p class='c004' >With the help of the night mechanician,
Garry got the Dragonfly out and set its engine
going.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then he hurried back to the control tower, to
discover that the landing had been made by the
Dart, as the flare had revealed.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then there was silence, and alert, but futile
watching, until Garry, watching the Northern
skies, discerned the approach of the helicopter,
as it swung along above the clouds, between two
of which its light pontoons showed for a second.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry rushed to get a strong electric torch.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ll send a blink-signal in Morse code,” he
told Don’s uncle.</p>

<p class='c004' >Waiting until the helicopter drifted down, he
sent the signal which Don and Chick
misinterpreted.</p>

<p class='c004' >From that moment onward, all was confusion.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry rushed, with Mr. McLeod, to the
Dragonfly, and prepared to take off.</p>

<p class='c004' >The signal man in the control tower,
watching the sky, sent them a triple flicker of the
pilot’s spotlight, agreed on as a sign that the
mail ’plane was in sight.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then came the delay that was caused by
Garry’s great excitement, so that he did not
get the Dragonfly off the runway at the first
attempt.</p>

<p class='c004' >Instead, holding the elevators down too long,
he got too near the end of the runway to risk
trying to climb above some wires that ran in
a diagonal line across the space ahead. Easily
cleared in a correct take-off, they might have
been the means of snagging the underbody with
Garry’s slight experience in climbing angles
and control manipulation.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Dragonfly, just at the end of the
runway, had to be turned, taxied back, and given
a fresh start.</p>

<p class='c004' >As he topped the wires on his second
attempt, Mr. McLeod prodded Garry. The young,
inexpert pilot, cutting the gun, and, fortunately
retaining presence of mind enough to drop the
nose to a glide as he cut power, looked around.</p>

<p class='c004' >The man in the second seat pointed aloft.</p>

<p class='c004' >In a quick look Garry took in the situation.</p>

<p class='c004' >Fearing the worst, he seemed to sense its
imminent arrival.</p>

<p class='c004' >There, above the edge of the bay, a cloud was
glowing. From his point of view he did not see
the flickering picture, but he guessed it was
either there or soon to appear.</p>

<p class='c004' >He gave the nose a tilt upward, opening the
throttle, as he saw the edge of the marsh
seeming to rise up toward the Dragonfly.</p>

<p class='c004' >As soon as he had climbed to a safer level
he looked again.</p>

<p class='c004' >There was the mail ship, coming down!</p>

<p class='c004' >He again cut the gun for a glide, the better
to watch.</p>

<p class='c004' >His heart was in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c004' >The mail ship was dropping swiftly.
Suddenly it side-slipped.</p>

<p class='c004' >Would there be a crash?</p>

<p class='c004' >“Poor Don!” gasped Garry, “he has sewed
himself up in an awful snarl if anything
happens!”</p>

<p class='c004' >At the same instant that the siren began to
scream its crash summons he saw the mail
’plane come out of the side-slip.</p>

<p class='c004' >To his amazement its pilot did not appear to
be aware of the Dragonfly, cruising in a gently
banked circle over the edge of the swamp, just
beyond the end of the runways.</p>

<p class='c004' >Instead, with a spiral, the pilot began to
climb.</p>

<p class='c004' >The beam of the airport searchlight flashed
into being, and as it swung past that mail pilot,
Garry, his head turned over his shoulder, caught
sight of the pilot’s arm upraised, his fist
clenched, being shaken furiously toward the
upper air into which the mail pilot climbed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He’s wild with anger!” Garry decided.</p>

<p class='c004' >He tilted his elevators to lift the Dragonfly,
full power being on as he made as steep a climb
as he dared.</p>

<p class='c004' >He must get above the clouds.</p>

<p class='c004' >If he could reach the altitude in time to
signal Don to descend, the young pilot in the
helicopter might avoid that sinister vengeance so
clearly planned by the irate pilot of the mail
craft.</p>

<p class='c004' >Clearly Garry saw that the man had been
anticipating some manifestation of the
haunting spectre, had planned a deliberate reprisal.</p>

<p class='c004' >Justly, as Garry realized, he proposed to take
into his own hands the vengeance due for the
terrible menace of the evil apparition.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But—it’s Don—and his intentions were
perfectly innocent!” Garry muttered, trying to
edge the throttle a notch further on.</p>

<p class='c004' >The clouds were just above him. He made his
climb into a banked, turning ascent, passing
through the thin edge of a fluffy vapor, to come
out into the clearer air on a level with Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >Already the young pilot was descending.</p>

<p class='c004' >But this was not evident to the infuriated
mail pilot who, coming straight at the helicopter
from a swing on wingtip at a higher elevation
over the swamp, made a ferocious dive, on wings
of vengeance, for the ungainly ship Don piloted.</p>

<p class='c004' >His intent was clear.</p>

<p class='c004' >With his “propeller wash,” or slip-stream of
turbulent air, he meant to upset the helicopter.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry held his breath. He could do nothing.</p>

<p class='c004' >The mail ship passed just behind the
helicopter.</p>

<p class='c004' >It wavered, tossed, bent far to the side—began
to go down—fast!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />SKY TACTICS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Clearly Don saw, as his helicopter wavered,
teetering like a dizzy baby trying to stand alone,
the venomous purpose behind that air
disturbing swoop.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, staring with wide eyes, his heart
stopped, felt the sway and quiver of the
cockpit and convulsively snapped the clasp of the
safety belt he had released to operate the
projector.</p>

<p class='c004' >Up, in a zoom, after his furious dive, the mail
craft’s pilot sent his ship. On wingtip, he came
around.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry saw his intention.</p>

<p class='c004' >So, too, did Chick and Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >The dive had sent the angry flyer down a
steep dive, past the helicopter and up, again,
in a climbing zoom, to a high point on which he
turned to come again past the other aircraft.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry realized that the man in that ship of
doom was beside himself with passion, beyond
reason. Don’s hand pressed the throttle. His
own engine revved up smartly. The upper
blades whirled faster.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Can he climb away in time?” Garry gasped.
Mr. McLeod, behind him, shouting, futile,
helpless, gave up waving his arms at the mail flyer
and watched Garry with wondering eyes as the
young and inexpert pilot at the controls of the
Dragonfly began also to increase his speed.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, opening up his fuel feed, felt the top
fan catch in steady air, saw the needle of his
altimeter tremble, begin to move forward. His
tractor, or pulling propeller, also operating,
began to show an effect.</p>

<p class='c004' >But whether he climbed, at the same time
moving forward, or not, the mail flyer could so
adjust his next dive that it would sweep the
helicopter’s air with that deadly, upsetting
propeller wash. Garry, too, realizing that, came,
as best he knew how, to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c004' >With his flying speed picking up rapidly, he
drove straight across the area between himself
and the mail flyer. His eyes, watchful and
narrowed, caught the instant at which the flyer
ahead dropped his nose.</p>

<p class='c004' >His own ship dropped its nose, and, with
throttle, open wide, giving his engine full
impulse the intrepid youth darted straight for the
area where he judged that the other man’s dive
would bring him.</p>

<p class='c004' >Carefully, so as not to spoil Don’s own air
too much and thus do what the mail flyer sought
to accomplish, yet making his attack as close as
his inexperience told him was safe, Garry drove
for the point where the other diving ship should
come.</p>

<p class='c004' >That dive of Garry’s spelled an instant’s
respite for Don. With a right foot slightly
pressing rudder bar, Garry swung the Dragonfly in
a gentle arc, as he went down, so that his path
of flight went as far to Don’s side as possible:
at the same time he would come back, he felt,
into a line that must either bring the mail ’plane
and his ship close, or the other, disturbed and
disgruntled by his unexpected tactics, must
side-slip out of danger.</p>

<p class='c004' >That was not quite the result.</p>

<p class='c004' >The mail ship, its control man seeing Garry’s
purpose, drew up his nose, kicking rudder and
banking—he sent the ship into an upward,
sidewise skid.</p>

<p class='c004' >It accomplished Garry’s purpose. Don,
climbing and moving forward at the helicopter’s best
speed, was out of the danger zone.</p>

<p class='c004' >The few seconds of advantage he gained
meant safety, because he had the helicopter
righted and working under perfect control
again.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, cutting the gun, not skilful enough
to dare sharp maneuvers, went on for some
hundreds of yards before he thought it safe to bank
and turn. A swift glance sidewise and backward
showed him that the mail ship had come out of
its skid, righted and again was executing a
wingtip turn.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Won’t the idiot ever give up?” Garry
muttered.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, watching the scene, unable to take part,
saw one point of possible advantage, if he could
only communicate with Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >In its climbing, forward position, the
helicopter was close to the same altitude that the
mail ship then had. Garry, in his last maneuver,
had lost a considerable amount of altitude, and
was, thereby, too low for anything but a climb.</p>

<p class='c004' >Still, as Chick almost instantaneously thought
it out, if Garry drove forward on a straight line,
the imminent dive of the mail pilot would bring
him into danger of a crash with the Dragonfly—if
only Chick could get Garry to fly forward,
on a level, at once, to get to that essential point
where he would be in the required position, the
mail pilot must turn.</p>

<p class='c004' >With wildly waving arms Chick tried to
attract Garry’s attention.</p>

<p class='c004' >The young amateur, busy watching his
controls, the steadying of his ship, planning his
next course, did not at once see Chick’s
movement.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick reaching forward, caught the
detonating mechanism of the Verey pistol, which he
knew Don had told him to load after their last
signal.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick fired the green Verey light.</p>

<p class='c004' >That made Garry turn his head.</p>

<p class='c004' >With the pilots’ code, arm movements, Chick
beckoned to Garry, as he saw the youth turn his
head that way: quickly, then, Chick held an arm
straight out in front of him. Rapidly he
repeated the gestures.</p>

<p class='c004' >As he began again to beckon, Garry, catching
his idea, revved up, his ship came on,
level-keeled and swift, just as the mail ship began
to come forward, itself on a power-glide of an
angle to bring it close to the helicopter.</p>

<p class='c004' >But Garry, coming fast, saw the value of
Chick’s signal.</p>

<p class='c004' >Full-gun, he used every ounce of power, every
hope of his earnest young championship for
Don and Chick, to send that craft of his into
place in time.</p>

<p class='c004' >The mail ship’s control man saw that if he
continued to come at the helicopter he must
come also into a line of flight that would
intersect that of the Dragonfly.</p>

<p class='c004' >Unafraid, determined, if need be, to risk all
to save Don from the vicious doom intended by
the infuriated, senseless man who had tried to
avenge a mistaken idea of the helicopter’s
purpose, Garry held on.</p>

<p class='c004' >The mail ship swerved away long before it
came near Garry and the Dragonfly. Don, its
pilot saw, would be above any safe dive he could
make, and he suddenly changed his tactics,
swerved and then, kicking rudder and
banking—but in the wrong direction with respect to
making a turn—the mail ship following its
controls, skidded upward, straight for the
helicopter.</p>

<p class='c004' >But its pilot did not want a crash.</p>

<p class='c004' >He thus got into a position where his
sudden restoration of balance put him just
forward of the helicopter.</p>

<p class='c004' >There, revving up to full speed, he sent back
over the tail of his ship that most terrible of
all man-made winds—the straight, hard fury
of his propeller blast.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don felt the helicopter stagger.</p>

<p class='c004' >With all his hope gone he felt sickish, as the
blast came. Not alone his own, but Chick’s life,
too, was about to be the payment for an
impulsive plan.</p>

<p class='c004' >But that Power above and beyond man’s
puny hates, sometimes called Luck, oftener
known as a good “break,” had caused the mail
pilot to neglect to return his elevators to
neutral; slightly raised, the tail surface caught the
full effect of his own deadly slip-stream,
sending the nose sharply upward, and thus making
that fury of disturbed air pass only the tractor
propeller of Don’s craft—so that its upper
blades at their best speed were able to draw him
up beyond the danger of worse than an instant
of horrifying danger.</p>

<p class='c004' >Stalled, the mail ’plane fell away, and its
pilot had his work cut out to avoid a bad stall.
Over the bay, although the clouds concealed it,
the mail ’plane, without pontoons, must quickly
get flying speed, or plunge.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, still rising, and Garry, flying toward
the swamp, saw another airplane, with the
unmistakable markings of the Government service,
come swooping from a higher altitude.</p>

<p class='c004' >Two red Verey lights, the imperative order
to land at once, flashed out from the newcomer’s
signal firing apparatus.</p>

<p class='c004' >That new craft meant business, was
commanded by some one in authority.</p>

<p class='c004' >Going, on his glide, below the cloud scud,
Garry circled out over the bay, came around to
face the light breeze, took the water with his
pontoons and shot toward the landing stages.</p>

<p class='c004' >As he skittered over the surface he saw
crowds rushing about in the wide area covered
by the landing lights; evidently everyone driving
home from late picture shows and dances had
heard the bellowing siren; the airport day force
was on hand; feverishly they worked to get the
first mail craft off the runways, as the second
came in.</p>

<p class='c004' >Two handlers caught the Dragonfly’s wing as
Garry drifted it to the landing stage. Further
out on the bay, Don set down the helicopter, to
Chick’s intense relief, without a jar. Shutting
off the top blades the young flyer used the
tractor prop to draw him to the place vacated
by Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >On the landing wharf Don, as he made sure
that Chick was again in possession of his
normal color, saw Garry, in the lowered rays of
the spot and other lights, surrounded by a
group.</p>

<p class='c004' >Doc Morgan was there, he saw. So, he was
surprised to see, were the two Indians, old
Ti-O-Ga and his son, John.</p>

<p class='c004' >Cars were parking everywhere they could find
space. Excitement was in the air.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We’ve got a lot of company waiting for us to
come home,” Chick whispered, with an uneasy
grin.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t like it much,” Don responded.
“Especially not the man in that ship that ordered us
down. He looks angry, from here.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well!” Garry pushed past the crowd
assembling around Don and Chick, “Don, do you
hear what they’re saying in the crowd?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes,” admitted Don, looking around.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We’re elected,” muttered Garry. “They say
the Ghost of Mystery Airport is caught!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Mr. McLeod, behind him, frowned.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I wish you boys had shown some sense,” he
told the trio. “It’s all very fine to discover
methods, and to tell others how mysteries are
worked; but it is pretty dangerous to show off
when mail is being brought in. That man in the
other ’bus is a postal inspector, by his looks—or
an army man out of uniform.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I know we were hasty,” Don said ruefully,
“but—we will have to face the music.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t think we’ll like the tune very much,”
Garry observed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No,” agreed Chick, “Garry’s pretty sure to
lose his flying license, at the very least.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The curt summons delivered by the man who
came to them from the last land ’plane to set
down, shoving his way through the crowd without
ceremony, proved that there was basis for
their uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well, young man,” the newcomer snapped,
“you and your scapegrace friends will come
with me, unless there is some one here, in
authority who will guarantee your safe arrival
before the New York Chief of my department
at nine in the morning. You can’t fool with
mail, trying your tricks and stunts to delay the
mails—especially air mail!”</p>

<p class='c004' >While Mr. McLeod conferred, sponsoring Don
and his chums, Chick put a hopeful look on the
face he turned to his comrades.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We’ll have the real ghost by morning!” he
whispered.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />EIGHT HOURS’ LEEWAY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Taking their cue from the abrupt, antagonistic
attitude of those who could overhear the
Inspector’s words, the crowd began to mutter and to
mill around, held back only by the lack of a
leader. The lack might be supplied by any
chance word of any among them.</p>

<p class='c004' >“This is a pretty bad spot,” murmured Garry,
softly, to Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >“How about some football tactics?” hinted
Chick. “We could break through the few
between us and the helicopter. It would be warm
enough to start easily.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“We’re not flying any more tonight.” Don
made a prediction he might find impossible to
keep. “Here comes Doc Morgan, and the
handling crew.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Working their way through the crowd, the
sturdy men who took the airplanes in charge,
as well as several shop workers, led by the
airport man-of-all-jobs, came around the edge of
the staging, while Toby Tew pushed forward
to join the group.</p>

<p class='c004' >Toby, the theatre manager, with his sense of
the way to handle an audience, stepped forward.
The leader had arrived; but he was on the side
of the threatened chums.</p>

<p class='c004' >His brief speech, begun with a half-laughing,
“Well, gentlemen, the show’s over,” and
ending with a cleverly suggested hint that they
might see something in the morning papers that
would compel them to come to the Palace to see
“Red Blood and Blue,” caused the crowd to
suppose the whole affair was what theatre folks
call “a publicity stunt,” devised to attract
attention, bring about talk and advertise the
picture.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Thanks for the way you handled that,” Mr.
McLeod remarked as the crowd, looking a trifle
sheepish, thinking itself hoaxed into attending
and helping along a publicity drive, melted
away.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Thanks for the ‘ad,’” Toby chuckled. “I
saw a way to turn it to my own advantage—but,
of course, I thought of it to get our young
friends out of hot water.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Thanks, a lot,” Garry said. “They might
have thought it would be a good time to give
some harum-scarum fellows a ducking—or
worse.” He became very earnest. “But,
honestly, Mr. Tew—and all of you folks—” Doc, the
handlers, the control chief and many friends,
heard his statement at the hangar door, “—we
meant only to try to lay the ghost of the spectre
in the clouds, that was all, by showing how it
was done.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He was believed, and presently the group
dwindled to the chums, the airport executive,
Doc and Toby.</p>

<p class='c004' >To their great surprise they were joined by
the pilot whose liking for “spooks” had started
the chums into the whole affair.</p>

<p class='c004' >Limping badly, with a heavy swathing of
bandages visible even under his loose trousers,
on his left thigh, Scott came slowly in.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well!” he greeted them, “I see there’s been
some excitement.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why, Scott! We thought you were pretty
bad when Uncle took you to the hospital last
night. Glad you came out so quickly,” cried Doc.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh—I had a good ‘break,’” the pilot said,
but his face showed his strain, for he winced
and drew wrinkles around his set lips as pain
seemed to attend each halting step.</p>

<p class='c004' >He had been grazed, he told them, by the
flying propeller, when it had flung itself loose from
its shaft on the Dart, the night before. The
doctors and nurses, he explained, had patched
him up—“Battered, but not busted!” was his
summing up of his condition.</p>

<p class='c004' >“They let me out tonight, and when I heard
the siren I got a lift, but couldn’t get to you
through the crowd.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He was optimistic about the situation as it
was explained to him by Don, Garry and Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t think they’ll do more than suspend
Don’s license for six months, at most,” he said,
“and then only if the postal authorities see fit
to notify the Licensing Bureau. Nobody got
hurt, you see.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But six months would be a long time
without any flying.” Don was despondent.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Not very!” argued Doc Morgan. “It would
soon go past.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But so will the eight hours between now—it’s
near one o’clock—and the time we have to
be at the Inspector’s office,” Chick declared. “If
we could find the real ghost, and take him—or
it—along, we’d be able to keep Don in the
air—where he loves to be!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“If the detectives can’t work it out, and the
rest of us can’t make head or tail of things,”
Scott grinned and then winced, dropping to a
chair in the shop doorway, “how do you expect
to manage it—in eight hours or so?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t know,” Chick looked very serious,
“but we’ve got an awful lot of clues if we can
fit them together—there’s the rubber outfit, if
we can locate it—oilskins, gloves—they’d have
finger prints to test.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes—” Doc glanced suggestively toward
Toby, “and the owner of a boathouse and dories,
who would be likely to wear oilskins—he might
be questioned.” Tew glowered at him.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There’s that tracing, if we could locate it,”
Garry added. “There might be fingerprints
on it, too.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Toby took his revenge.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes,” he admitted, “they might be on the
bottle—the one a certain person emptied or
spilled, the night he was where the tracing was
found!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“When it comes to that,” Doc flashed back,
“somebody had his initials on that—er—tracing,
I recall,” he glanced meaningly toward the
control chief.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Casting suspicion and making mean remarks
won’t get the boys along,” Scott hinted. “Have
you any other clues? I don’t suppose you
searched the boathouse thoroughly—or the
helicopter, maybe?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“We were too excited.” Garry turned quickly.
“That makes me think—we might bring in the
projector and the film cases—there might be a
clue we didn’t notice in the dark. They ought
to be kept in a locker, anyway—like the
others——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“What others?” Scott leaned forward, and
then, perhaps recalled by pain to his injuries,
he groaned, and slumped back, his lips set.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We found—well, never mind,” Chick was
about to tell their whole story when he caught
sight of Don’s expression.</p>

<p class='c004' >His eyes swung to follow those of his chum.</p>

<p class='c004' >At the hangar doorway, on either side, were
two intent, coppery-red faces, one old and
seamed, the other young and alert.</p>

<p class='c004' >The others followed the line of Don’s gaze.</p>

<p class='c004' >“In the name of all-possessed!” exclaimed
Toby Tew, “if it isn’t the Indians!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Out rushed the crowd—down the runways
toward the line of cottages backing onto yards
near the swamp edge, raced the quarry.</p>

<p class='c004' >They outdistanced the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c004' >Old though he was, Ti-O-Ga kept pace with
his son. The black dark of swamp, where none
knew of any existing path, stopped the chase.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Funny, wasn’t it,” remarked Don, as he
returned to find Scott, unable to join them,
waiting eagerly for results. “I never thought much
about those two Indians—not in connection with
this. But—that old one is smart—only-—why
would they haunt the swamp, around here? I
can’t imagine they have any grudge against my
uncle. Uncle Bruce doesn’t know them, I’m
sure.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Maybe Tew wasn’t so far off, earlier—how
about it, Toby?—saying this was all a ‘publicity
stunt’ for his picture!”</p>

<p class='c004' >The theatre owner smiled a strange,
unrevealing smile.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I wonder—” reflected Scott. “Good stuff for
the newspapers, if he did work it—but
dangerous for the pilots! Man who Never Lived! A
queer, disappearing map. Ghosts in clouds.
When do you ‘spring’ the advertising part, eh,
Toby?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Toby was not permitted to reply.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, turning, saw Chick rush excitedly up
from the staging where the helicopter was
securely staked and tied to the waterside posts.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Look!” Chick was so excited that he
galloped toward them, capering and waving a
large, round container, of some shiny metal, as
he advanced.</p>

<p class='c004' >In the case where they had found the
projector and lamp, he cried, he had, on
searching, discovered a can of film.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I opened it to see if it was the same film
we used,” he reached the group.</p>

<p class='c004' >Scott started up from his chair, Doc came
close, his face set and eager. Toby, with a
muttered, “Gosh-a-mighty!” became very attentive.
The injury of the pilot must have reminded him
of its pain, for he sat down quickly again,
wiping his brow.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What did you find?” demanded Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Unexposed film!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Un—film that hasn’t been exposed?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick nodded.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But how do you know?” Don cried. “Film
is all of the same yellowish color till its been
developed. It could be exposed—and—oh, dear!
I suppose you opened the can and there might
have been enough light to fog the film—and we
may have lost a very telling clue!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Maybe not!” cried Scott. “Take it up, and
develop the first few ‘frames’ and see. You
know how to handle the time-and-temperature
tank powders, Chick. You go and develop some
of that film. Don, will you and Garry help me
to my boarding place? I’m—all in!”</p>

<p class='c004' >They took him, limping painfully, to his
bedroom. There he turned.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Good glory!” he muttered, “fellow—I
forgot! Doc—and Toby—and Vance—and those
two Indians—are about the place—and Chick’s
all alone with that—maybe it’s a clue! Sorry I
brought you. Go back, fellows! Run!”</p>

<p class='c004' >They ran!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVI' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br />A “FLYING FILM”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Up to the dark room Don hurried with Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >At their knock a muffled voice came through
the panels, hardly to be understood because of
the weather-stripping used to make the joining
of door and frame light-tight.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He says he can’t let us in,” Don caught the
faint murmur and interpreted it.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Taking the film from the tank, I guess,”
Garry responded. “We’ll have to wait.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Five minutes passed. Then the door was
opened.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, with hands stained by contact with
pyro and other chemicals, showed a
disappointed face.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No go!” he greeted his chums. “The hangar
light fogged the film. It was light-struck, all
right.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“How about another test, from the inner end
of the roll?” Garry suggested.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We can try that,” agreed Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >Into the intense blackness of the room they
crowded, and, by sense of touch Don extracted
from the inner spool of the roll, an inch or so
of film, while Garry washed out the developing
tank used for the films they took of new craft
for making half-tone engravings, pictures for
circulars, catalogues and “trade paper”
illustrations.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, mixing a fresh charge of pyro, with
sodium sulphite and the right amount of
carbonate, from ready-prepared packets, enclosed the
film in a roll of rubber-edged material that let
the developer seep in but keep the fabric from
touching the delicate film surface.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Get the tank lid tight,” he warned Garry
after the solution had been mixed and poured
in, the film container being swished up and
down to get the film full impregnated. “I have
to light the bulb to time it and get the
temperature of the mixture by the thermometer you just
had in the tank.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Go ahead—it’s tight.”</p>

<p class='c004' >They allowed twenty minutes for
development; then the light was extinguished and the
door, opened for ventilation, was closed.</p>

<p class='c004' >In darkness Chick removed the film, handling
its container gingerly as he immersed it in the
hypo fixing bath to “set” the image. They gave
it about half a minute of darkness in the
fixing bath.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Now we can see it,” he decided. “Switch on
the——”</p>

<p class='c004' >The door swung sharply outward.</p>

<p class='c004' >There came a blinding flash, and with it the
dense smoke of some pungent, gas-reeking
chemical. Eyes smarted and watered.
Staggering back from the surprise attack, totally
unexpected, Don, Garry and Chick took an instant
to cower back against the wall, shielding their
faces.</p>

<p class='c004' >There was the play of a flashlamp about the
room.</p>

<p class='c004' >Then, before either of them could recover
from astonishment and from the choking
smudge enough to move, there came the clank
of some metal, and the slam of the door.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh!” Chick gasped, and then said no more,
choking in the smoke of the bomb or whatever
poured its dense, stifling smoke up, filling the
small, almost airtight compartment.</p>

<p class='c004' >It took Garry, nearest the door, half a minute
of choked, almost suffocated effort, fumbling in
the dark, to get the handle of the door and
twist it. The door was not locked; but, as he
dragged Chick out and Don leaped over the
fuming, pungent smoke-flare that had been
ignited and dropped in the dark room, Garry saw
that the rubber catch-all mat on the floor was
burning.</p>

<p class='c004' >The designing room, with its unreplaceable,
valuable files, was adjacent to the dark room.
Below, in the workshops, “dope” and other
dreadfully inflammable materials lay stored. In
the hangar next it were airplanes worth
thousands of dollars, including a fourteen-ton,
double-bodied seaplane that had been ordered
by the Mexican Government.</p>

<p class='c004' >“One go one way, the other to the bank
stairway—or the fire escape!” he screamed to Don
and Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >Himself, ignoring the lost film—knowing well
that was what had vanished in the hands of
their adversary—Garry raced for a fire
extinguisher.</p>

<p class='c004' >Choked, blinded, staggering, Don and Chick
heard, but had difficulty getting their bearings.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry ran, full speed, back, to upset the
chemical fire extinguisher so that its contents,
mixing, would generate a gas to drown out the
small, but menacing fire that had already
touched the matting running from the
designing room corridor across that side of the space.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don staggered to the window, drawing in
great lungfuls of fresh air.</p>

<p class='c004' >Gasping, choked, he strained his eyes toward
the grounds outside. Chick, at the corridor
door, looked up and down, bracing against the
dizziness that swung him on his unsteady legs.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry drenched the matting, the smoking
flare, the floor and walls in danger.</p>

<p class='c004' >The fire out, he dropped the extinguisher, and
turning, raced, with Don and Chick,
recovering rapidly, at his heels. He, too, was choked;
but at the first opening of the door Garry had,
fortunately, thrown a sleeve protectingly across
his face, so that he had breathed less of the
fumes than his companions.</p>

<p class='c004' >Up to the control tower balcony raced Garry.
Don went down to the hangars. Chick took the
midway corridor, searching each office.</p>

<p class='c004' >“There he goes,” shouted a voice.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, rushing to the balcony, saw a fleet
figure running across the grounds, out of the
good light, but discernible. Into the
searchlight Garry ran, while Don and Chick, hearing
his shouts of response to the voice from below,
went, careless of risk to limb, down the
stairways at front and back of the big building.
Garry, struggling to get the searchlight turned
in the proper direction to pick out the fleeing
figure, to identify it in a flare of vivid light,
explained swiftly to the control chief on duty.</p>

<p class='c004' >By the time the light was in position, on the
roof, and its mechanism adjusted, the beam
probing the velvety dark night picked up a
scene of swift action.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don and Chick, close to the hangars, were
running, full tilt, out of the grounds, along the
roadway.</p>

<p class='c004' >A hundred feet beyond them were two
heavier figures, pounding along at a slower
pace, so that Don and Chick soon met, passed
and out-stripped them.</p>

<p class='c004' >Just beside the cottages that were boarding
places and providers of furnished rooms for
airport mechanicians, shop workers, pilots and
others, a fleetly running, light form swerved
out of the light just as Garry got to the
balcony again.</p>

<p class='c004' >Behind a house the figure vanished.</p>

<p class='c004' >It had some round object clutched in the crook
of an arm, Garry thought.</p>

<p class='c004' >Standing there he watched until Don and
Chick reached the spot.</p>

<p class='c004' >In the bright rays of the light they soon
returned, waving arms in dismay. While they
stood, undecided, a window of the nearer
cottage flew up.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry could not hear the voice, but he
recognized Scott.</p>

<p class='c004' >He watched as Don and Chick, calling
upward, waited, received an answer, turned and
raced back toward the hangars.</p>

<p class='c004' >The upswung arm of Don, the upward
pointing finger of Chick, told Garry what was
wanted.</p>

<p class='c004' >Down the stairways he plunged.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Quick! Henry—help me!” he shouted,
running toward the Dragonfly.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don appeared at the door.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s right!” He saw Don pushing at the
tail of the aircraft.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What’s it all about?” demanded the
mechanician, to whom all this in-and-out pushing of
the “busses” was mystifying.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Scott called down to us. He was dozing
when the light woke him. He got a glimpse of
the man running away,” Don informed him.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It was the Indian—John Ti!” contributed
Chick, putting his weight behind the wing of the
ship as he helped get it through the doors.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well—then he went into the swamps!” the
man said. “That’s the only place he could get
to from back of that house.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I know it!” puffed Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What do you want this crate for, then? You
don’t expect to see a single, Indian kid, hiding
in a pitch-dark swamp!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No!” gasped Don, “we don’t. But—Henry—we
left the Dart tied there!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Get all the flares you can find!” Garry urged
Chick, himself busy looking over the fuel
gauges and oil supply.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick raced away, fully recovered.</p>

<p class='c004' >They got the Dragonfly into the air in short
order.</p>

<p class='c004' >Three determined youths, each tightly
strapped in place, each with a supply of
signal flares, of rockets, of flash bombs, of white,
red, blue and green Verey lights, went forth
into the sky lanes, determined that their clue,
considered important by Scott, should be
recovered.</p>

<p class='c004' >In the swamp a lithe figure, watching, seeing
the ship coming over, muttered.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He shan’t get away!” Don whispered, half
aloud, to himself, in the Dragonfly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He shan’t get away!” muttered the lithe
figure swiftly untying the Dart beside the
boathouse wharf.</p>

<p class='c004' >To which an older, more deeply
copper-colored form grunted agreement, whirling the
fight propeller to “contact!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Then began a most peculiar sky chase!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br />WHITE WINGS AND RED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Holding the Dragonfly barely higher than the
wires he must top as he took off, Don sent the
craft toward the swamp.</p>

<p class='c004' >As soon as they swept beyond the cottages
that backed their small yards on the undrained
swamp, Chick sent overside his first white-light
parachute flare.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It’s only for safety’s sake,” he muttered.
“That young Indian, if he knows the swamp at
all, has had time to get across to the Dart. But
he might try to fool us, and stop to hide. Not
likely—but we must be sure!”</p>

<p class='c004' >He, and Garry, watched over the side, a little
afraid that with the craft of his forefathers
the red-skinned John might so cleverly crouch
in the eel grass that they might not see him.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don dropped the nose, however, allowing the
Dragonfly barely to skim the low patches of
water, and clumps of gently waving marsh
vegetation.</p>

<p class='c004' >As soon as they got beyond the vivid glow of
the light slowly floating down toward the marsh,
Don climbed the ship three hundred feet, came
around, side-slipping to lose altitude as soon
after the next flare was ignited and launched
as he could.</p>

<p class='c004' >By these tactics, continued for several minutes,
the three chums satisfied themselves that
the Indian was at least not visible; and if he
remained hidden for that long they had him!</p>

<p class='c004' >“By now,” Garry decided, as he strained his
eyes overside, “the police must have gotten out
here to surround the swamp. Mr. McLeod
agreed to get the Chief to bring all his force,
and to send out his private detectives, and get
every waterman to help as guides.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, climbing away from the final flare,
gestured ahead. As he gave a glance backward he
saw Garry’s signal of agreement. They must
get within easier guarding distance of the Dart
at the piling of the boathouse.</p>

<p class='c004' >As quickly as he saw that the swamp was
being surrounded, the Indian might resort to
flying for escape. It was not known whether or
not he could fly the Dart; but Don surmised that
he could. He had managed the helicopter.</p>

<p class='c004' >When they climbed, steadily going ahead, to
a good altitude over the swamp Garry turned
his head, observing that Chick saw the same
thing that he did as a white, floating flare lighted
up the terrain beneath them.</p>

<p class='c004' >There were two figures visible on the
planking of the outer wharf at no pains to conceal
themselves.</p>

<p class='c004' >Instead, they were feverishly unfastening the
light airplane, and Don, at Garry’s touch,
nodded to show that he already was aware of
the fact.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That Indian can fly!” Don muttered.</p>

<p class='c004' >He braced his nerves for an unusual effort.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, too, was taut with excitement; his
nerves tingled with expectancy; he would have
little to do, yet he must be ready to play what
part might be possible.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, less excitable, was inclined to feel
misgivings.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What I understand about ship design makes
me think this won’t be as much a test of skill
as it will be of performance,” he murmured to
himself, not having the Gossport apparatus
because it had been left in the Dart.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It is going to be a test between ‘controllability’
and ‘maneuverability’ this time,” Garry
added softly.</p>

<p class='c004' >He realized that airplane design taught the
truth that a craft with a certain type of
stabilizing fins, and control surfaces, might be very safe
and steady in the air, and yet not respond
quickly to its stick and rudder, because stability
carried to that point might compel a sacrifice of
quick answering to control movements.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s the Dragonfly,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c004' >Light, speedy, almost “touchy” in its easy
response to control, the Dart, on the other hand,
lacked that safety margin.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Dragonfly could not go into and come
out of aerial “stunt” positions with the same
facility that the Dart had. The Dart, though,
was so “touchy” that, with its margin of quick
answering to controls, quick “stunting”
possibilities, it was far less easy to keep in stable
flying control.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We can’t out-maneuver the Dart, if they once
get into the air,” Garry decided, “but, then, the
Dart isn’t as easy to hold steady as our ’bus is.
One thing in our favor will be that Don knows
this ship better than John understands the Dart.
And—with Don against John,” he thought,
whimsically, “it’s a queer thing that our
Dragonfly has wings of white and the Dart is
lacquered and doped in red.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He smiled, being of a calm, humorous
character.</p>

<p class='c004' >“White wings or red?” he added. “We’ll have
to see what we see!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, almost over the boathouse at the
moment, gave a swift look to estimate the progress
made by the two beneath him.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It will take a minute to warm up that
engine,” he decided. “We can get into position!”
His plan was to make a swoop from a fair
altitude, just timed to take the steadier ship
across the path of the other, and slightly above
it, as it took off.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The propeller ‘wash’ will throw him out of
control too low to catch that touchy Dart,” he
told himself. “It will put them down before
they get high enough to be hurt badly. I don’t
want to be the means of injuring anybody, if
I can help it.”</p>

<p class='c004' >He came around, and gave a quick glance to
see the progress of the starting Dart. In the
vivid light from a flare that Chick had put over
he saw that the red-winged craft was beginning
to skip over the water.</p>

<p class='c004' >It was headed into the wind.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why don’t you tell him to dive?” screamed
Chick, shivering with excitement and biting at
his lip in vexation. Garry had deliberately
ignored prodding by his younger comrade.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Now!” Garry touched Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >Has calmer nature had held in check his
impulse to move too soon.</p>

<p class='c004' >Exactly in sympathy with Garry’s touch, Don
decided that the time to plunge, to rush past
and above the Dart, and then to zoom away into
the sky for a turn, and an observation, was just
right.</p>

<p class='c004' >Full-gun, with nose lowered, the Dragonfly
dashed toward its target, coming up, in a gentle
curve, just timed to sweep the turbulent air
disturbance of their propeller through the area
into which the Dart was just beginning to rise.</p>

<p class='c004' >They swept with roaring engine across the
sheet of water, their own pontoons and
wheel-trucks not twenty feet away from the red wings.</p>

<p class='c004' >Up they zoomed; Don brought the nose
around with as sharp a bank as he deemed safe.</p>

<p class='c004' >All three looked, expecting to see the Dart
upset, and its occupant or the pair, if the older
Indian had joined his son for escape, struggling
in the murky water.</p>

<p class='c004' >Instead, the Indian, with the cleverness that
he had learned, as they discovered at another
time, from enlistment at a Navy training school,
had cut the gun, settling into the water again.</p>

<p class='c004' >He had anticipated their maneuver.</p>

<p class='c004' >Before they could get around and before
Don could decide on whether to repeat the dive
or to discover some other way of preventing
ascent, the Dart strung in a boiling curve, one
wingtip pontoon barely touching water to help
it swing, and, with the wind, leaving in the water
a hot, white seethe of broken wake, slanted
sidewise to the breeze and rose.</p>

<p class='c004' >With skill and quick yielding to control, the
Dart swerved around into the wind.</p>

<p class='c004' >Straight away, climbing rapidly, the small
craft went.</p>

<p class='c004' >After it, gunning up to top speed, went the
Dragonfly.</p>

<p class='c004' >On a level, Don’s speed about equaled the
climbing speed of the angle taken by the Indian.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Will red wings get away from white wings?”
murmured Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Catch him, Don!” screeched Chick, unable to
hold his quivering nerves as they made him
tremble with eagerness. He felt like a coursing
greyhound, urged on a trail but held by a
restraining leash, willing to use his own effort,
but restrained.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, more controlled, watched.</p>

<p class='c004' >Along the channel swept the strange chase.</p>

<p class='c004' >Higher came the Dart. Straight at it, but
some hundreds of yards to the rear, tore the
Dragonfly, white wings chasing red.</p>

<p class='c004' >“When he gets on our level,” Don murmured
through clenched teeth, “his speed will get him
away. If there was anything to do——”</p>

<p class='c004' >Answering its easy controls as he stopped,
surprised, the Dart, almost at their altitude,
swerved.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, not expecting a turn, kicked rudder
nevertheless, to swing on the new flight path.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Dart, still climbing, made almost a
complete, 360 degree turn.</p>

<p class='c004' >At the half-way point, almost half a circle
accomplished, Don went around on wingtip, to
get the nose on a new point—he meant to make
a direct diagonal across the turn, to try to meet,
or forestall, the Dart.</p>

<p class='c004' >But the smaller ship’s pilot, with gun full
open, nose up, seemed almost to leap upward
before he reached the stalling point.</p>

<p class='c004' >He had caused Don to lose the advantage of
altitude.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Clever!” Don conceded, seeing the effect of
the ruse. “Now he has only to fly straight away,
and we will lose him in twenty miles.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick uttered a cry of surprise.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry’s teeth shut tight in dismay.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don caught his breath</p>

<p class='c004' >Living up to the name, Dart, the lighter ship
went into a wing-over, a maneuver by which,
dropping a wing, and thus executing a turn, as it
regained flying margin of speed, it exactly
reversed the direction of flight.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Dart, instead of going away from the
Dragonfly, had completely altered the
conditions: it was coming at the bigger craft.</p>

<p class='c004' >Just above, and right over the Dragonfly came
the other, full-gun.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don felt the propeller stream tear at his right
wing.</p>

<p class='c004' >There his own ability, coupled with the great
steadiness of the ship he handled, saved the
situation.</p>

<p class='c004' >Gently, not forcing or over-controlling, he
recovered stability.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Why!” Don screamed, “he tried to upset—us!”</p>

<p class='c004' >The pursued had turned pursuer!</p>

<p class='c004' >Wingtip went down, came up, steadied. Don
again had control.</p>

<p class='c004' >Over went Chick’s next flare, to light up the
sky.</p>

<p class='c004' >They picked up the enemy ship, quickly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He’s made an Immelmann turn!” shouted
Garry to Don. By that maneuver, half a dive,
half a climb, to get the ship to the top of a loop,
and then a barrel roll, half-way, to bring it
again on its proper keel, again the Dart was in
position to swoop.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He wants to drive us down, I think!” yelled
Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >Although he could not hear for the roar of
their own engine, Don also saw that the greater
maneuverability of the other gave him an
advantage they had not counted on. Thinking they
were to be the hounds, and the Indian the hare,
the chums found the conditions reversed. The
hare, in his ruddy-winged craft, proposed to
hunt down his adversary.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, realizing the danger to those with him,
desiring no risk of life or limb or property, in
the light of the flare, not yet dying, held up both
hands in the old war-sign, “Kamerad!” and
swiftly caught his stick and throttle again.</p>

<p class='c004' >In the other ship the arm of the pilot pointed
downward.</p>

<p class='c004' >He did not, however, try to enforce the order
to descend by any more swoops: instead, he
maneuvered the light craft to a level with, and
not fifty feet beyond the Dragonfly.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, uncomprehending, puzzled that they
were being ordered down, when it had been his
expectation to give that order to the other, let
the nose drop a trifle, cut the gun, and went on
a gentle glide, showing his intention to obey.</p>

<p class='c004' >The young pilot, red of face, skilful of
control, flew along, and as they came almost on a
level with the flare, burning still, he turned his
head for a glower of triumph toward his victims.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, his eyes turned that way to watch the
wing separation, saw a look of amazement
change the triumphant scowl.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Indian pilot put out and waved an arm—he
pointed toward the airport.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don nodded, banked, submissively, so
astonished and mystified that he could not further
plan. Why had that coppery face shown
astonishment?</p>

<p class='c004' >It was a puzzle added to many problems.</p>

<p class='c004' >With the other craft riding hard, above them,
circling swiftly, the captors, now captives,
obeyed the signal already given.</p>

<p class='c004' >Over the edges of the swamps, searchers’
parties showed lights as they realized that the chase
had ended, as they supposed. To them it
appeared that a ship was being compelled by a
skilful adversary to go back. That was
true—but it was the pursuing ship that had
capitulated.</p>

<p class='c004' >Hardly had Don run out of speed, and, with
Garry and Chick, leaped out to clear the
runway, before the lighter Dart came home.</p>

<p class='c004' >“For the sake of all that’s mysterious!”
called Don as the Indian cut his ignition. “We
thought you were trying to escape. What made
you turn on us?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I thought you were the pilot I’m after—and
I meant to get the man who stole our treasure
chart!” Again the chums were stupefied.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVIII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br />THE STORY OF A MAP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Turning away, the red-skinned pilot helped
his father to the runway.</p>

<p class='c004' >The old medicine man was stiff from the
cramped position, and somewhat shaken by his
“stunting” trip through the air lanes.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, belligerent and impulsive, followed
John.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What did you mean by throwing that smoke
flare in on us?” he demanded. “You might have
suffocated us!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I did not throw anything!” the young Indian
retorted, cool and quiet, as he steadied his
father. “We watched, that is all. Some one
else is to blame, not I. And—when I find
him!——”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, seeing his face, felt glad that he was
not the target of an emotion that contorted the
copper-colored face into the mask of a veritable
fury.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Let’s go to the hangar,” Don suggested.
“Maybe we can talk this out.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Come!” agreed Ti-O-Ga, moving away.</p>

<p class='c004' >Doc Morgan, Toby Tew and some of the
handlers who had stayed around
discussing the exciting night’s events, looked
disappointed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I think I’d like to come, too,” observed
Toby. “In the name of all-possessed! This is
a queer business.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“It certainly is,” Doc agreed, and without
invitation he ranged himself alongside of the
theatre manager as the latter went with the
party.</p>

<p class='c004' >Mr. McLeod and the control chief joined them
in the designing room.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chairs and benches were brought. Everybody
found a seat.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, before he sat down, hurried to the
developing room, as Don supposed, to estimate
the damage done. Chick went in, did something,
came out. Water was heard in the washing tanks.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What did you mean by saying you thought
we were the ones who had stolen a map?”
demanded Garry, as Chick took his place again.</p>

<p class='c004' >Readily enough, the Indian began to explain.</p>

<p class='c004' >“My father has met a good many strange
people, because he is so well-known for his
cures,” he began. “A good many years ago he
nursed an old sailor, and when he found he
couldn’t cure him, Father told him the truth.
The man was grateful, though, because he knew
Father had done his best. He knew he couldn’t
live, and he turned over to us a map.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The map, he explained, was old and tattered.
It showed, the sailor had claimed, a place in the
Long Island swamps where, during a bad gale,
many years before that, a pirate brig had been
blown at high tide inland so far that it had
become caught in the mud, and that ship, thus
held prisoner, had been sucked down in a spot
even then known as the Devil’s Sinkhole.</p>

<p class='c004' >“And, as the man told us,” John continued,
“the ship had some chests of jewels and gold
and silver aboard.” He had been given a map,
and the story, by his father. Coming down from
generation to generation, the tale and the chart
had yielded nothing to searchers.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Jewels—gold—silver!” Chick spoke in awed
tones. “A treasure ship!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes,” the young Indian nodded. “I was a
schoolboy then. I went to Carlisle, and then
enlisted in a cadet training school for naval
pilots, but several years ago, when I was about
to be graduated, the hard times struck the world
and the navy decided not to take on any more
flyers, and I was too young to become a
commercial pilot, so I gave up my course and went to
work at whatever I could get.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Many an army and navy cadet has been
disappointed by learning he couldn’t keep on,
after his enlistment term,” commented Mr.
McLeod.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, who had always felt a respect for the
older man, now began to feel a strong liking
for the straight-forward Indian, his son.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I went to work at a Long Island moving
picture studio as an extra,” John went on.
“There I saw a chance to write and sell a
story—and we made quite a good amount of money
by playing in it.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“We enjoyed your acting in ‘Red Blood and
Blue,’” Don commented.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But what about the map?” Chick broke in.
“While we were working at Long Island
City,” John informed him, “I used my spare
time to study the swamps, and discovered that
there was a spot, near this airport, known as
Devil’s Sink. I was in the swamp a great deal,
but if there had ever been a ship, the mud had
covered every trace of it. We gave up, Father
and I. But—and this is why I’ve told you all
this—because I took an interest in aviation, I
was around the seaplane base that was here
before the airport was begun. I met some of the
flyers. I suppose they wondered about our
investigations, but of course we kept close
mouths.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Any of us would!” agreed Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Father went back to the Catskills, to
continue his doctoring,” John completed his
astonishing revelation, “I went ‘on tour’ with the
first of our films, making ‘personal
appearances.’ That was before we had the smoke-trick
scene thought out.</p>

<p class='c004' >“When I came home Father told me about
several of the airport folks, who had been
visiting him. One was a pilot who said he was in the
mail and commercial end of it——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“A mail flyer!” cried Chick. “Well—that’s
interesting!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You mean—Smith?” Don inquired, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s just the trouble,” John stated. “He
came while Father was off doctoring a man in
the back country. He called himself that. My
mother isn’t very quick with her old eyes. He
had his flying togs on, too, and she couldn’t
describe him closely except that he was tall, and
thin.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“And so was the mail flyer who came in
tonight,” Chick cried. “The one we scared, so
that he turned on us and tried to force the
helicopter out of control. We’re getting close to
something—I think!”</p>

<p class='c004' >The man they discussed, apparently loitering
outside the door, came in.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Is that so?” he said sharply, defiantly. “I
can tell you that you will be getting close to
trouble if you start accusing me——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“What’s all the excitement this time?” Scott,
limping down the hall, dropped gratefully into
a chair that Don vacated. “I see you got the
Indians——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“They got us, you mean!” explained Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well—any way you want it. Did you
recover—the film?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Didn’t they have it!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No!” John turned to answer courteously,
“we had no film.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You’re interrupting a thrilling treasure
story,” warned Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >He and Garry, with interruptions from Chick,
quickly put the pilot who liked spooks in
possession of most of the important points.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well! It’s wonderful!” Scott commented.
“We’ll soon have that gibbering spook in the
open. I’ll keep still, though. Go ahead, Mr. Ti.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“There isn’t much more,” the young Indian
stated. “A mail flyer came to our place, while
my father was away, and wasn’t very easy to
describe, because of his flying togs. But one
thing Mother did tell us&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c004' >“What?” Chick was on the edge of his seat.
“He had a little vest-pocket camera!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“He took pictures,” commented Garry. “I
wonder what for?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“If you want my guess,” Don spoke up, “he
wanted to get the locality clear in his mind, to
study out how to go back—and—get the map.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Worse than that!” the young Indian told
them. “Father thought little of the camera side
of his visit until, first Doc Morgan, and then
Mr. Toby Tew, and then Mr. Scott, came up,
doctoring or for some reason that was covered
by that excuse. He began to wonder, and wrote
me. I cancelled my picture house engagements
and went home—just before you two young
chaps came along with the injured pilot.” Don
and Garry nodded.</p>

<p class='c004' >Their arrival, and the story he gathered about
the swamp, and the odd apparition haunting the
air, had made the old, wise medicine man
wonder, John added. He had deduced, sagely
enough, the real motive for the apparition. It
was, as the Indians believed, no ghost-scare
devised to ruin the airport owner and his venture.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We decided,” John stated, “the ghost was
being made to create a big scare among pilots
and to keep them away from the swamp!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I think you are right!” Garry exclaimed.
“I see it, now! If the flyer wanted to study that
swamp—he’d do it from the air. He wouldn’t
want other pilots coming along to catch him
flying to and fro—but, at that—how would he
know what to look for—and where?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“The camera!” the Indian said. “Father
went to his cupboard, where the map was stored,
and found that while it had not been stolen,
actually, it had been displaced. He had it under
some other papers——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Was he sure he remembered just how it had
been left?” asked Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I got memory—never forget!” the old
medicine man remarked briefly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes,” John agreed, “Father knew just how
it had been—and it was not the same. It had
been found—the look showed scratches where it
had been picked, and then re-locked. That pilot
had taken a picture of the chart!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That accounts for the tracing on thin
paper!” Chick saw a clue. “He had to enlarge
it, to study it, if he made the picture with a
vest-pocket camera. That film isn’t much larger
than the film in a motion picture camera—he
enlarged it, and from the enlargements on
tracing paper, he copied it—and then camouflaged
the map on the tracing by adding the wings and
struts and frames. And—then he slipped in the
hangars and removed the tracing from Mr.
Vance’s drawer, and took the blue-print I had
made—so we haven’t got far, after all.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No,” Garry agreed, and turned once more
to John.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What did you do about it?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Came here, kept quiet, watched. I kept
sending Father word, and tonight, early, somebody
told me that mail pilot who had been up at our
place once was flying the mail! I lost my
self-control. I was in a rage, I hated that fellow.
He had cheated, falsified his errand, imposed on
my mother’s good nature——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Just a minute,” Scott broke in, “who told
you he was coming in?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I got the call at the theatre—just before the
‘presentation’ was on the stage,” John stated.
“He called me up—told me the flyer who had
been at our place—and he knew I was looking
for the man, he said—was flying in the mail.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Did he say who was calling?” Don was
excited.</p>

<p class='c004' >The eyes of the young Indian turned, covered
the group.</p>

<p class='c004' >They rested on Doc Morgan.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You’re crazy!” The-man-of-all-work leaped
from his chair. “I won’t stand for that, I won’t.
You shan’t accuse me. I never called—I did
not!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You did—I think I recognize the voice!”
cried John.</p>

<p class='c004' >“And was it you who flew over in the
helicopter, out of the swamp, and tried to drive us
out of control with rockets?” demanded Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes. My father was in the moving picture
theatre, in the room with the projectors, and he
wheeled the spot lamp across to a window, and
used it to light up and blind you! But I thought
you were the man who had taken our property.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“So that’s how the queer searchlight came
into our eyes!” snapped Chick. “You know what
sort of crime that is? Endangering flyers!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“We thought you were the mail ’plane,” John
said regretfully. “Just as I thought you were
the culprit trying to get away just now when I
used the Dart to drive you down. But—I’m
sorry.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You’d better be sorry you’ve accused me,
too!” stormed Doc Morgan.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes,” Scott agreed, “I’m not sure that isn’t
all made up! What were you doing at the
airport, just before the film was stolen from our
young friends? I saw you—running!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick sprang up.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It doesn’t matter!” he cried. “Let’s stop
accusing—and find out! The pieces we saved
are about washed by now. Come on—Don-Garry!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIX' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <br />CLUES IN CAMOUFLAGE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Smelling still of the fumes from the smoke
flare, which someone—Doc Morgan probably—had
cleared out, the dark room was close and
unpleasant as Chick closed its door and,
switching on the white printing lamp, faced his two
friends.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Let’s be very quiet,” he said, earnestly. “I
was only half listening to the arguments. While
they went on I thought of a way to draw the
real ‘Ghost of Mystery Airport’ into the open—or—into
the darkroom!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t understand,” Garry spoke softly,
although the door was tight.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You mean by showing what we had clipped
out of the film?” Don asked. “It was just put
in the fixing bath—how do you know the fumes
of the chemicals in the smoke bomb didn’t ruin
it—stain it or fog it?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I don’t care a whack of a stick about the
clippings,” Chick stated. “This is my plan. When
I was in here before, I put the bits of film in the
wash water, but they were all dirt, and
chemicals. I don’t believe they’re worth bothering
with. But—I know that the ‘ghost’ is among
the people in the designing room. Doc followed
Toby. Mr. Tew volunteered to come and listen.
The air mail pilot was loitering around,
listening. The two Indians——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh, I’m sure it’s one or the other,” Garry
agreed, “but that doesn’t tell us your plan or
how we can see which one it is. For my part,
I’m in favor of looking at the film clippings.
If they show us that we have the right idea, that
a flyer has been taking pictures over the swamp,
it will prove he is looking for the treasure, and
not just trying to ruin Don’s uncle——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Oh, we know the motive—treasure hunting,”
Chick retorted. “That’s been our trouble,
before. We’ve tired so hard to show what was
being done, and how, that we couldn’t take time
and brains to discover—who!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry was a trifle nettled.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I suppose you are going to discover ‘who’
without even looking at the clue Scott thought
might be in that undeveloped film.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’m going to make him—discover himself!”
Even Don stared.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry laughed, a little scoffingly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“All right!” Chick took the implied unbelief
good-humoredly. “Think this over: If you had
flung a smoke bomb, and gotten away with
evidence, and you heard somebody say they had
some already developed—what would you do?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Run!” chuckled Garry.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I wouldn’t!” Don saw Chick’s argument.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’d be uneasy, and uncertain, and I’d worry
until, finally, I might feel compelled to come and
see just how much you had against me!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s my plan!” retorted Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry agreed with Don. It was clever of the
youngest chum.</p>

<p class='c004' >“While we wait, we might as well see if we
have evidence, or whatever it may be—against
anybody!” Don added.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick lifted the wet film from its washing
bath, handling it carefully by the edges to avoid
spoiling the wet, swollen, delicate surface
emulsion containing the pictures.</p>

<p class='c004' >Holding it up to the light, he showed a smoky,
already somewhat distorted image in one piece
of the clipped film.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I can see—letters,” Don said, peering toward
the light. “There’s an ‘A’ followed by a figure
‘one’ and then—it’s spoiled by scraping on the
floor when the fixing trap got upset.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Just on the edge of the last ‘frame’ of
moving picture film, you can see a flat, opaque blur,”
Garry commented. “That’s an aerial picture,
taken from above! I’ve seen those air
photographs in the movies. What’s to prove this is a
picture of our swamp? It’s all fogged!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“I count more on our ‘ghost’ coming here
than on that film,” Chick declared. “I’ll put
that in a drying clip, and hang it behind the
tanks in case we can use it sometime. Now,
here’s the other clipping!”</p>

<p class='c004' >The second one he exhibited was more clear.</p>

<p class='c004' >“That’s the swamp, all right,” Garry
commented. “The first one is one of the smoked-up
parts we threw away after the first trial. But
this one is the swamp, and no mistake. That
is,” he corrected himself, “it’s a section of it,
along the water front. See how the shore curves
in and out—and the beginnings of Crab
Channel and the other smaller inlets?”</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick and Don assented; but the pictures
gave them nothing new to go by, more than
assurance that somebody had flown over the
swamps to take air films. Of course, as Chick
argued, that fitted in with the idea that the
mysterious “somebody” had put the projector head
and the other things into a locker of the pilots’
quarters as a means to throwing suspicion on
another, as the key in the control chief’s old
coat and vest proved. The film with it was not
the same as that used for the apparition in the
cloud. It was only a “blind,” as Chick argued.</p>

<p class='c004' >Also, as Don added, the film could have been
taken by the control chief as well as by another,
except that he was seldom away daytimes.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But Doc Morgan is,” Garry remarked. “And
Toby Tew is in and around the swamps all
Summer, and could easily hire some pilot from
another airport to fly him—nobody would have
paid much attention, because the engineers were
using airplanes, too. And I think it was to stop
the engineers from draining the swamp before
he had taken the treasure that our ‘ghost’
worked his spectre-in-the-clouds!” he added.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Sh-h-h-h!” Chick caught each by an arm.
“Listen!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Footsteps sounded on the floor outside,
approaching. Were they hesitating? Did they
echo with such caution because they belonged to
a guilty body? Slowly they came closer.</p>

<p class='c004' >There was a knock on the door.</p>

<p class='c004' >“When I open the door—grab him!” Chick
urged.</p>

<p class='c004' >He waited. A hand tested the door knob. The
door rattled a little.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Open up!” came a muffled voice.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Wait! Let him get anxious!”</p>

<p class='c004' >A thumping came on the door.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry and Don grew tense. Chick’s hand was
on the bolt.</p>

<p class='c004' >It shot back.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Now!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Out they dashed, to encircle, to grapple with
a figure standing off guard.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Here! Stop that!”</p>

<p class='c004' >The voice, deep and curt, made them draw
back, look up at the form and face they released
in amazed disappointment.</p>

<p class='c004' >They had captured the Chief of Police!</p>

<p class='c004' >“Uh—er—” Don stammered, “we—we expected—the—the ‘ghost!’”</p>

<p class='c004' >“If you can prove you’ve caught him you
can have my badge,” the good-natured officer
chuckled. “As a matter of fact, I came in to see
what was the result of your investigations. My
men are all in the swamp, awaiting orders. We
saw you bring in the Indians—they’re all out
in the other room still, waiting for a report;
your folks are, I mean.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What have you got in the way of evidence,
clues or proofs?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004' >They told him and showed him their bits of
film.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Wouldn’t stick in any court,” he stated.
“Any finger prints are washed off long since,
and the pictures could be cut from any news
reel picture of airplane flights for observation
purposes. No, boys——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“We thought the ‘ghost’ would come to see
what we had discovered,” Chick said lamely.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well, I’m not the ‘ghost.’ You’ll have to try
some other scheme.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Don’t you think this ‘A’ and the figure ‘one’
might help?” asked Garry, indicating the
smoked film, dimly showing the letters.</p>

<p class='c004' >“It might—if there was anything to tie it up
with.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“If only we had the tracing of the Indian’s
map,” Don said ruefully. “Or the blue-print
Chick made—that had some sort of complicated
figures on it&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Where is it—where is either one?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“They were stolen, Chief.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes!—” Chick’s face became suddenly vivid
with excitement, “yes!—but—when I made the
blue-print, I picked up two pieces of paper and
only discovered it after I had exposed the paper
under the tracing!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Hastily he switched off the white lamp,
putting on the ruby light.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I put the other sheet back, because it didn’t
show much—but, you all know, there is a way
to force up a stronger image—with intensifier
chemicals.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Feverishly Chick searched in the laboratory
cupboard.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry aided him, while Don got the trays
cleaned, and the Chief came in and closed the
door.</p>

<p class='c004' >Half an hour later Mr. McLeod caused the
door to be opened to him.</p>

<p class='c004' >“What’s going on?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Look!” Don’s trembling finger indicated a
faint, but clearly discernible figure on a sheet
of printing paper. The blue-print had been
developed as far as it was possible to bring out
the figure. Then a greatly under-exposed camera
photograph had been made, on sensitive film,
and this, by process of development known to
Chick and the rest, intensified the lights and
shadows which were more “contrasty” because
of deliberate under-exposure. The result was a
readable print.</p>

<p class='c004' >There was the camouflaged map, apparently
the hull outline of some old-fashioned ship,
seagoing brig or privateer, with its sharply
cut-under prow and overhanging stern, its roughly
outlined deck and wavering waterline. Over
that, distinguishable because in an ink that was
dark and printed out whiter, was the outline
of the airplane sketch.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Camouflage!” Mr. McLeod agreed, “but——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Excuse me, Uncle!” Don interrupted. “If
you will study that design, carefully, the way we
have been doing for the past three minutes, and
remember all that has happened, you’ll see
that there are two clues in the camouflage.
But we don’t want to stop to explain them. We
want the ‘ghost’ to play his
last ‘engagement’—and—we think he will!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Then they walked out, in a group, to the
larger room where the unsuspecting culprit
waited.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXX' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXX<br /> <br />BAITED WINGS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Never had Toby Tew “staged” at his Palace
a better “presentation” than the one the chums
were about to enact. With the Police Chief
aiding, they had worked out a plan that must
almost certainly bring their quarry to them.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don, with excited face, raced through the
designing section of the big hangar’s upper
floor, at the end. Doc saw him; Toby saw him;
so did others, under suspicion.</p>

<p class='c004' >“All right, Chief!” he shouted over his
shoulder, “sorry we haven’t room in the
Dragonfly to take you along; but we’ll signal
with a set of red, white, and blue flares when
we find the treas—after we’re through.” He
pretended to correct his supposed slip.</p>

<p class='c004' >Old Ti-O-Ga barred his way to the door.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You find?” he grunted.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Think so!” Don admitted. “Tell you
better after I’ve made sure!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Where you think you find?” The old
Indian stood firm.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don was secretly delighted: this gave him
an opportunity.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You see,” he explained, “after a
photograph was made of your map, it was enlarged,
and a tracing was made, of the larger size. That
tracing was disguised with airplane parts, but
it still looked like the hull of some kind of boat,
a brig, or a brigantine. The ‘ghost’ was
plotting the swamp out in narrow strips. The
design enabled him to put lines across, looking
like inch and foot divisions—but they were all
sections of the swamp. You see, he flew to and
fro, over the swamp, taking moving pictures.
Then he kept a projector head here, in a locker,
and when nobody was on this floor, at night,
he’d develop his films, dry them in our dark
room, and then project them by putting the
projector head in front of our enlarging camera
lamp. He was searching for any place that
looked as though a ship had gone down. But—he
was all wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“How was he ‘all wrong?’” demanded the
control chief eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004' >“He was looking for a sunken brigantine—or
some sort of boat!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“How was that so ‘wrong?’” the mail pilot,
lurking in the background, wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We saw through the camouflaged design,”
Don said. “We had a developed picture, what
camera men in the movie colonies call a ‘shot’
of the swamp, from very high up—a wide-angle
shot! It showed all the creeks and channels.
We compared that with the blue-print we had—that
the ‘ghost’ didn’t take away!” he spoke
meaningly, “and we saw that the little mark
probably indicating the treasure place, in the
real map, that looked as if it was just a frame
joint in the airplane sketch, and showed the
treasure in the hold of the ‘brigantine’ at the
stern, was really a mark at a point in one of
the swamp channels!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You don’t say!” Scott bent forward.</p>

<p class='c004' >“You see, the part of the map that looks
like the deck of the brig—is—Crab Channel!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“In the name of all-possessed!” cried Toby
Tew, “tell us the rest—quick!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“The wavy line is the other channel, almost
parallel with Crab Channel,” Don was willing
enough to speak, “and the line that looked like
the stem of the ship was really the shore line
between the channels while——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“The bow part must have been the—” Doc
Morgan was shaking with excitement, “—the
little channel alongside of the boathouse.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Gosh-a-mighty!” Toby leaped up, “that
cross in the tracing was right by the boathouse,
then. In the name of all-possessed—to think
I’ve been storing dories right over
treasure—let’s——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Just a moment!” The Police Chief entered
with Mr. McLeod. “Nobody goes out of here
except Don and his Airlane Guard. The
treasure is the Indian’s property if found. No one
else gets a chance to rush ahead and secure it—if
found! Stand aside, Ti-O-Ga!”</p>

<p class='c004' >The Indian, realizing that he must obey,
moved away. Don dashed out.</p>

<p class='c004' >Anyone in the upper windows at the hangar
side, watching, could have seen the Dragonfly
take off almost before it had rising speed, and
go roaring into the dark swamp air. They could
have seen, and some did see, a landing flare go
over near the sheet of water where the
boathouse stood.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Did you telephone—and get the answer we
expected?” Don asked Garry as they tied up
the Dragonfly to a part of the old wharf.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I did, and Chick is about to unload what
he found—in the boarding house room you
mentioned!”</p>

<p class='c004' >They took some cased objects, and a
projector head, out of the cockpit, carried them
into the old hovel, set them up by hooded
flashlight rays, and then sat down in a corner to
wait.</p>

<p class='c004' >The water slapped and gurgled under the
flooring. An hour passed. The wind that
changes at dawn began to sigh and moan
through the cracks of the old wall.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well—” Don stretched, wearily, “it’s
almost dawn. Maybe our plan won’t work—listen!
Here comes—somebody!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXI' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXXI<br /> <br />“THE MAN WHO NEVER LIVED”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Through the door came a muffled hail.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Hello, inside the boathouse!”</p>

<p class='c004' >According to a plan already made Don
tiptoed into a dark corner as Garry went swiftly,
silently, to the other, nearest the land side of
the old building.</p>

<p class='c004' >Chick, smallest, quickest of the three,
crouched close beside the closed door, pressed
tightly against the wall.</p>

<p class='c004' >A hand fumbled at the latch. The door
swung sharply inward. A beam of light leaped
across the enclosed space. Instantly Chick
lunged forward: his arms wrapped about a
pair of slim legs.</p>

<p class='c004' >“I’ve got him!”</p>

<p class='c004' >As the man toppled forward Garry and Don
came like panthers from the respective corners,
springing on the figure. Realizing his
helplessness their antagonist grunted a surrender.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don kicked the door shut. Garry saw that
his comrade placed his back against it, and let
go his hold. Chick sprang back, tense and
ready for any surprise move.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Just as I thought,” Don said triumphantly.
“The air mail flyer!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“And what of it?” The man got to his feet,
as Garry picked up the electric flash and laid
it on the table, still glowing.</p>

<p class='c004' >He directed its beams on a quantity of
objects they had set there, ready for such a
climax.</p>

<p class='c004' >“We’ll tell you,” Don began. “First, Mister
Pilot, you learned from the Indian, John, that
there was some treasure hidden somewhere in
this swamp. You went to the Indian village,
concealing most of yourself in your pilot’s
togs. Then you located the map Ti-O-Ga had,
and took a picture of it with a vest pocket
camera, came back and used our dark room
enlarging outfit to make the tiny picture big
enough to trace out and then you camouflaged
that map tracing with wings and other
airplane parts.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry turned his light on various objects as
he took up the accusation.</p>

<p class='c004' >“This is the vest pocket camera.” He
brought it into sharp relief. “Chick found it
in your cottage room.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You’re crazy! I never owned one.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“No use blustering!” Chick cried. “The
whole thing is plain to us! You wanted a
bigger map so you could lay out cross-sectional
lines on it and number them. I made a
blue-print of the tracing while we had it and by
good luck I had picked up two pieces of paper
to print on, and then put one aside, the lower
one; but it was clear enough, after we made a
contact negative from it on film, and then
redeveloped and intensified that! We saw the
cross lines, and the figures on the paper checked
with figures on the bottom of the tracing, most
of them being checked with pencil checks to
show they had been covered.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“And what did I do that for?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You laid out a chart of this swamp over
the camouflaged map,” Don took up the
accusing story, “then you went to Port Washington
and bought an amateur movie camera, and a
lot of film. Garry knows the photography
store owner, and he got his home, tonight, and
learned that a man in pilot’s togs who said
he was a mail pilot, bought the outfit.”</p>

<p class='c004' >The man was impressed. “Clever, but not
true!” he scoffed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“All through the mystery,” Chick cried,
“you have been camouflaging! You covered
your trail by putting suspicion on others. That
tracing, in this place, puts suspicion on the
theatre man, Toby Tew, because he was one
who’d know how to do the ghost trick with an
old airplane crash film and a projector.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You put the key to the locker where you
hid the projector you used at the hangars, late
at night, in the control chief’s vest, because he
might have been able to cast airplane shadows
on clouds with the searchlight beam!” Don
spoke crisply, “and—you camouflaged the map—but,
then, you overdid it!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Yes!” agreed Garry, “you went too far.
You wanted to make the tracing seem like a
new design, after you saw the control chief’s
initials on the tracing he left here! So you
drew in on the entering-edge of the wing’s a
‘slotted-wing’ sketch. Now, the control chief
knows light, but he doesn’t know that a slotted
wing is an invention that helps to reduce
‘burbling’ in take-off, and lets the ‘camber’ of
a wing change automatically—that’s too
technical for a control man. Only a pilot would
know that, because it’s patented and controlled
by one English firm.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“And your camouflage showed us that the
man we wanted must be a pilot, just by that!”
cried Don. “Then we examined the
frame-bracing and saw the little cross-mark you had
to show where the map said to look for buried
treasure—only you were looking for a ship!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“All very cleverly worked out—but you’ve
got the wrong man!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“We’ll see! Chick, set off the red, white,
and blue signal to the Chief,” Garry ordered.
Chick’s move toward the door was arrested
by a startling sound under the flooring. They
all stood petrified.</p>

<p class='c004' >Slowly they wheeled to watch the trap in the
corner. It opened. Up came the green-capped,
green-masked head, the oilskin shrouded body
and rubber-gloved hands of their Demon—the
Man Who Never Lived.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Gosh-a-mighty!” he croaked hoarsely, “but
you’re bright boys!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Toby Tew!” Chick exclaimed, recognizing
the phrase. “You!——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“In the name of all-possessed!” croaked the
figure, “who else?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You’ve got your ‘nerve’ to brazen it out
this way!” Garry said; but there was a strange
look on his face; the voice, for all its
disguising hoarseness, seemed oddly familiar—and
not that of Toby. “Are you just doing it to
try and save this mail flyer?”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Gosh-a-mighty!” the figure retorted, “no!
Time’s passed for trying to camouflage, that’s
all. You think you read that traced chart? You
didn’t! That cross telling where treasure was
hid, now! I put it on the tracing to keep you
away from the real spot, same as I bought an
old, discarded skeleton from a hospital and had
it discovered to start people looking in that
locality—far away from where I dug and
scooped in mud.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Well,” Chick cried, “you are caught! The
swamp is watched. When you left the Chief,
he had you watched.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Gosh-a-mighty! No such thing! He left us
all go. All I had to do was to go home, start
to go to bed, get these togs, walk down to the
seaplane landing stage, tell the detective on
guard I was a special officer assigned by the
Chief to patrol the swamp shore—then in I got
in that crash boat—and here I am, with good
tail-winds and everything my own way!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You’re not Toby Tew!” Garry exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Toby doesn’t talk about ‘seaplane landing
stages’ and ‘tail winds.’ Those are aviation
and he’s a boatman as well as a theatre man—and
he can’t fly!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Then it’s Doc!” cried Chick.</p>

<p class='c004' >“No!” Don had caught the expressions and
rightly judged them. “Doc couldn’t draw an
airplane tracing: certainly the only other man
besides this mail flyer, who knows about slotted
wings and can make them is——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Scott!”</p>

<p class='c004' >As Garry shouted it the disguised man
nodded.</p>

<p class='c004' >“But—Scott flew us here at the first,” Chick
expostulated. “Besides—he’s injured!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Camouflage!” laughed the man, brazen and
triumphant. “I got you to fly here to make
sure you wouldn’t suspect me. Besides, it
helped me get the ship here, so I could go in a
dory to my helicopter, and ‘put on my sky
show.’ Then—with the storm coming, I had
the Dart to get back in: I used these oilskins,
while I dug. I had the tracing made to guide
my aerial photography, and as soon as I
located the buried chest I left the tracing
where it would get Doc suspected. I left a
key where it might incriminate the control
chief. The more people you suspected the
more I could work. I had to burrow for that
treasure—but—now—I’ve got it all loaded and
ready to fly to a place where a boat can take
me out to the twelve mile limit. There a
rum-runner will ship me for parts unknown. As
far as being hurt by the ‘prop’ goes, I
pretended that to get out of flying that night—I
knew the Indians were after me. And
now——”</p>

<p class='c004' >“You can’t escape!” taunted Chick. “The
swamp is surrounded.”</p>

<p class='c004' >“But the police left some very powerful
arguments where I could get them—and they’ll help
me escape instead of catching me.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Then the figure on the ladder snatched a
round, queer object from under its oilskins.</p>

<p class='c004' >Instantly the reference to police supplies
became clear to Don.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Look out!” yelled Don. “Tear-gas—don’t
breathe—run!”</p>

<p class='c004' >The bomb flew, dropped, burst. Garry and
Chick, their sleeves held over their faces, leaped
toward the doorway; but the bomb, flung at
Don’s feet spread its fumes swiftly. The trap
door slammed to the roar of exultant laughter.</p>

<p class='c004' >The pilot, off guard, stumbled against the
table and fell. There came a cry and a cough—and
silence. Choked, gasping, with smarting
eyes streaming with tears, the chums staggered
out.</p>

<p class='c004' >“In case you might wonder—” Scott’s voice
floated to them from the humming electric
launch, “I left the hospital the same night I
pretended to be injured by the propeller—I
knew the Indian was going to try to drive me
down, and pretended to be laid up. But I
could run fast enough to come back, smoke you
out and get the film—it had a picture on it
I didn’t want seen—and I flung it out into the
swamp and went back to my room—put the
things that you found in that mail flyer’s room
where you saw them—and came back to stay
with the Chief till he sent me off to bed—only,
I came here to load the treasure. Now—good-bye.
It flies in five minutes!”</p>

<p class='c004' >“Not much it doesn’t!” muttering, choking,
coughing, Don gasped orders. Flares to signal,
as soon as Chick and Garry got the pilot out of
the house. His job was to start the Dragonfly.
He staggered to the wharf-side, dropped into
the craft—saw that the ignition wire was cut!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXXII<br /> <br />A FLYING FINISH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003' >Feverishly Don worked with spare cable to
wire around the ignition switch and get his
engine going.</p>

<p class='c004' >From the boathouse staggered Garry and
Chick, coughing, their eyes streaming. They
dragged, by the shoulders, the unconscious pilot.</p>

<p class='c004' >“His head must have struck something!”
gasped Garry, dabbing at his eyes. Suddenly
something snapped into his mind.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Chick!” he choked and gasped, then turning,
stuttered, “my first aid—kit! I left
it—on—path—promontory—when—mail ’plane went
down!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Staggering, but bravely eager to help a man
who was hurt, the youth took his way off the
wharf, along the path, into the grass toward the
end of the shore that curved out into the inlet,
making the wavering line of the channel on one
side.</p>

<p class='c004' >The roar of an airplane engine came—but it
was in the air!</p>

<p class='c004' >Don looked up. There was the Dart, coming
over, shooting the water landing, making its
approach, coming in, setting down!</p>

<p class='c004' >He recognized, at its controls, as he flung
aside his helmet, the pilot who had been injured
in the first crack-up, the night they saw the
apparition: he had been driven down from the
farm by its owner and was sufficiently healed
in his arm to handle stick and throttle.</p>

<p class='c004' >With him was the Police Chief.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Get him?” hailed the officer, as the gas was
cut and switch put off, and as Don shook his
head, shouting his explanation, the Dart ran up
close to the wharf.</p>

<p class='c004' >“The swamp is surrounded,” the Chief cried.
“We let them all go, as you had planned. Didn’t
the culprit walk into the trap?” Don told him
breathlessly what had happened, urged that the
Dart go aloft and scout.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Chief urged Don to occupy his place,
while he attended to the man over whom Chick
was working incompetently.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don hesitated: they might need to use the
Dragonfly, also, he protested. The newly
recovered pilot suggested that Don fly the Dart,
reconnoitering, as it was the less stable ship
and in his condition he preferred the steadier,
more easily controlled craft. They began the
exchange, listening for a motor. No sound came.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, recovering his strength, if still
teary-eyed, blundering along to find his abandoned
first aid kit, saw the Dart go in, and felt that
for all his bravado, Mister Spook was almost
as good as captured.</p>

<p class='c004' >He broke through the tall grasses, near where
the path ended.</p>

<p class='c004' >His eyes saw an amazing sight! There, where
the mail ’plane had gone into the mud, fresh
planking had been laid across the mud, and on
it rested the airplane, the boards concealed by
wings and a camouflage of cut grass: its broken
hull had been re-covered, freshly doped. It had
no pontoons; but on each side of the fuselage
slanted auxiliary wings of thin boards had been
attached by wire. If it could be started and
raced off the board support, he saw, the slanted
planks would serve to lift it higher with each
gain of speed, as a boat of the speed type is
lifted by its side-flanges. And—in his
disguising garments, Scott was working feverishly at
the motor. Garry leaped forward. Scott tore off
his mask to show a face of fury and dismay.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Stand back!” Scott lifted a small missile.
Garry knew the tear-gas and its effect. He
hesitated.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Shame!” he cried. “You can’t escape. Even
if you did fool us by taking us to look for your
own self, at the start, you can’t fool us any
longer.” He was talking against time, getting
his feet set.</p>

<p class='c004' >“Come and turn that prop, or I’ll—throw
this!”</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry changed his tactics; meaning to leap,
ducking the missile, he altered his plan. “All
right!” he agreed, docile with pretended fear.</p>

<p class='c004' >He moved toward the propeller, stepping on
the edges of the boards.</p>

<p class='c004' >He saw the electric crash launch floating just
beyond the nose of the ship. Menaced with the
tear-gas, he nevertheless made his leap, across
the water, from the planks, that gave under him,
to catch the coaming of the boat’s cockpit. The
missile flew through the air after him, but
Garry, in the channel, went down, until his feet
touched mud; holding his breath he swam under
the launch, coming up on the other side. He
trod water, concealed.</p>

<p class='c004' >To his dismay he heard the man, discarding
his disguise, twist angrily at the propeller of
the repaired airplane. It caught on a firing
point of the engine, swung rapidly. The man
rushed along the planks.</p>

<p class='c004' >Drowned by the noise close at hand, Garry
failed to hear the Dart rev up its engine,
turning to get into the wind.</p>

<p class='c004' >In it was Chick and at its controls was Don.
Garry disregarded all danger, clambered into
the boat, tumbling in close to the wheel and
switch. He tore at the latter, sending current
into the motor. With a howl of rage Scott drove
his airplane off the makeshift runway and
straight at the launch. He hurled a missile.
It did not strike the boat.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry backed water, up the channel. The
airplane had to take the air or foul its wings in
grass. It rose. A bomb dropped—Garry, full
speed astern, avoided it and backed up the
channel. He could not turn.</p>

<p class='c004' >Up soared the Dart. It came around. Don
saw the mail ship turning to cross the bay.
Full-gun, he took up pursuit, heedless of the Chief’s
warning that their tear-gas, brought in case the
swamp yielded the culprit, had been taken, must
be in the hands of the escaping Scott.</p>

<p class='c004' >Seeing that the Dragonfly’s pilot had trouble
with his arm, Don knew he alone stood between
Scott and escape.</p>

<p class='c004' >The Dart was fast. So was the mail ship, once
free of the water.</p>

<p class='c004' >Garry, backing up the channel, saw Don fly
over. He kept on, until he reached the wider
sheet of water, backed around, swung close to
the Dragonfly, climbed aboard, and feverishly
begged to have a chance at the controls. The
other pilot, not too strong, yielded. The
Dragonfly started.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don climbed, losing some advantage; but he
knew that it would be a long chase—wanted it
to be so. The man in the mail ship, with his
bravado serving to the end, lifted and showed
strings of jewels that flashed vividly in the first
rays of the rising sun.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don saw that Scott meant to cross to
Connecticut. It would be a run across Long
Island Sound. Don did not want to drive down
the ship over water—he would lose the treasure.</p>

<p class='c004' >He saw, far behind, the Dragonfly.</p>

<p class='c004' >The crossing was made in record time, and
then Don, in a ship easily maneuvered, raced
up above the other. Then Chick screeched a
warning.</p>

<p class='c004' >Up toward them came one of those missiles—a
tear-gas bomb.</p>

<p class='c004' >Don made a quick barrel-roll. It caused the
bomb to miss him.</p>

<p class='c004' >Falling, the missile was in the path of the
mail ship. Straight into it, as it fell, Scott
raced. It smashed in his cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004' >Doomed by his own act, he lost control, and
in a slanting, catapulting dive, struck just
beyond the shore line, on firm earth.</p>

<p class='c004' >And thus the Ghost of Mystery Airport
passed.</p>
